The set J comes from the labeled set G (which is a sample of tuple pairs after the blocking step which we have labeled as matches or not matches).

J is the evaluation set which we use to test our final learning-based classifiers. We do not perform any debugging or tweaking whatsoever using this set, and we only use it to evaluate the final performance of our classifiers as an indicator of how they will perform on unseen data.
