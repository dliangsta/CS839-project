"On the week, Bitcoin is up around 15% but Litecoin is leading the run...\n\nWhile Bitcoin remain down 30% year-date, it appears that amid the recent cataclysmic collapse of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency hammered out a low earlier this month, as dip buyers scooped up coins below $6,000.\n\nNearly eight days from the low, the auction has soared by more than 50 percent probing a 20 simple moving average at 9,162.\n\nWe now have an idea who one of those dip buyers were and the amount they purchased.\n\nAccording to BitInfoCharts, a mysterious buyer with a Bitcoin address of 3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64 purchased an astronomical amount of bitcoins worth $344,000,000 at a blended cost basis around $8,400 from 02-09-18 through 02-12-18.

It was the government's first coordinated response to the public uproar over a justice ministry proposal in December to shut digital-asset exchanges.\n\nBut as we have noted previously, this rebound is very much the norm, seasonally as China's lunar new year approaches..."
