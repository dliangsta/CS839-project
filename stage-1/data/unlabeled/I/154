"It's been a strong bounce-back in America since the big dip last week. That's a sign of strength to me.\n\nBuyers bought up shares that went on sale.\n\nThis good momentum should keep flowing into the Australian market.\n\nBut let's wait and see.\n\nOver in crypto land, things have bounced there too. Bitcoin is now trading back above $13,000.\n\nIt got a little hairy there for a while.\n\nIt may get even more so if Jim Rickards is to be believed.\n\nHe maintains you should avoid bitcoin.\n\nThat's not my view, but I'm always happy to hear out a man of his standing.\n\nRemember the days (about six months ago) when bitcoin was going to revolutionise banking and disintermediate the mean nasty 'banksters?'\n\nWell, a funny thing happened on the way to the revolution. Bitcoin itself has hit an air pocket with a 50% price drop since December.\n\nMeanwhile, the banks that were supposed to be so dramatically disrupted by bitcoin are taking over the blockchain.\n\nThis is not surprising. Disruptive technology does come along from time to time, but established franchises have a way of either fighting back or co-opting the new technology just by buying it.\n\nUber is disruptive, but London taxi drivers (the best in the world, by the way) have organised to get Uber's license there revoked.\n\nIn the same spirit, it was na\u00efve to expect that banks would just sit there and let blockchain technology eat their lunch.\n\nAll of the major banks have blockchain research and development projects underway.\n\nJapan is the first major economy to declare bitcoin 'legal tender' in payment for goods and services.\n\nThis does not fix a value for bitcoin, and it does not force anyone to use bitcoin, it just keeps bitcoin transactions safe from counterfeiting charges.\n\nThe Japanese banks are taking that opening and driving an armoured car through it. Japan's largest bank is creating its own crypto-currency.\n\nValuation won't be an issue because each coin will be worth exactly one yen. It's really just an alternative payment system like PayPal.\n\nWhat it does is allow bank customers to make and receive payments on the blockchain with a yen equivalent, but with much lower costs.\n\nAlso, because this is a 'permissioned' system (customers only may participate with bank approval) verification does not require the clunky proof-of-work of the original bitcoin blockchain.\n\nDistributed ledgers and blockchain are here to stay, but bitcoin is not. The banks will see to that.\n\nAnother major argument bitcoin advocates made was that it was invisible to the IRS.\n\nWell, not really. I'm reminded of a story from about 15 years ago...\n\nA Swiss banker loaded all of the confidential information on Americans with Swiss bank accounts that he could find onto a CD-ROM.\n\nHe then flew to the United States and handed the information over to the US Treasury and the FBI.\n\nThe banker was in trouble for helping Americans evade taxes and this was his play to avoid prosecution.\n\nHe blew the whistle on his clients. What ensued was a 10-year manhunt by U.S. tax authorities to find the tax evaders and many more whose information was not included on the original CD.\n\nThe U.S. played rough not by chasing the individuals, but by putting pressure on the Swiss banks themselves.\n\nThe big Swiss banks like UBS, and Credit Suisse have huge capital markets and wealth management operations in the US.\n\nThe US told those banks they could either hand over the information or we would shut down their US operations.\n\nThey handed it over.\n\nSome of the tax evaders got lawyers, turned themselves in and paid their taxes (plus interest and penalties) to avoid jail time.\n\nOthers waited and ended up in jail. Today, if you go to Switzerland and try to open a bank account they will turn you away; they have zero interest in taking on US clients.\n\nNow something similar is happening in cryptocurrencies. The US Treasury is concerned that cryptos are the 'new Switzerland' where Americans are hiding income and avoiding taxes.\n\nThe Treasury is probably right about that. Treasury will use the same hardball tactics against the cryptocurrency exchanges they used against the Swiss banks.\n\nThe IRS is already demanding all records of crypto-currency transactions from these exchanges including name, address, social security number and bank account information about their clients.\n\nThe bitcoin fans who mock the government and play 'catch me if you can' will find out the hard way that the US government has the resources to track them to the ends of the earth.\n\nThis is just another sign that reality is catching up to the bitcoin market.\n\nI've said for years that bitcoin is a fraud, a Ponzi and a bubble all at the same time. I based this on analysis of price activity and certain other technical analyses and some anecdotal evidence.\n\nCritics have always demanded 'proof' that bitcoin was a fraud with smoking-gun-type evidence.\n\nThat was difficult at first because of the secretive nature of bitcoin trading. Yet now the evidence is arriving almost every day.\n\nNew hacks are reported, millions of dollars of bitcoin routinely go missing and exchanges are closing with no recourse for investors.\n\nWhat may be one of the biggest frauds in history, this one involving bitcoin, is now coming to light.\n\nOne cryptocurrency exchange called Bitfinex owes customers hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin held in their accounts.\n\nBitfinex is nontransparent about the funds it actually has on hand and whether its customer funds are really safe.\n\nBitfinex sponsored another cryptocurrency called tether, which is tied to the US dollar at a one-to-one fixed exchange rate.\n\nCustomers give tether $1 (or the equivalent in another crypto) and receive one tether in return.\n\nThe amounts paid for the tether are supposed to be held in reserve to back up the one-for-one promise.\n\nNo one knows if tether has the funds or not. Tether recently parted ways with an auditor who was supposed to answer that question, so there is still no transparency.\n\nIt also seems that every time the price of bitcoin plunged, millions of tethers were issued out of thin air to prop up bitcoin on the Bitfinex exchange.\n\nAll of this has raised suspicions that Bitfinex and tether are Ponzi schemes.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, the US government sprang into action by hitting Bitfinex and tether with subpoenas demanding information about reserves and the safety of customer funds.\n\nIf it turns out the suspicions of fraud are correct, it could start a run on the bank in all cryptocurrency as holders and investors lose confidence in the crypto space generally. That would be bad enough.\n\nBut the greater fear is that panic in cryptocurrencies could spill over into regulated stock and bond markets and mark the beginning of another global financial panic.\n\nIf that happens, it'll make the recent correction look like child's play. And the best asset to own will be physical gold."
