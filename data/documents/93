"Bitcoin (BTC) is trimming gains, having set a six-day high above the $9,000 mark early Saturday, according to CoinDesk's Bitcon Price Index (BPI).\n\nThe cryptocurrency ran into bids at $8,608.62 at 00:14 UTC and jumped to $9,070.64 at 07:17 UTC - the highest level since Feb. 4. As of 12:00 UTC, the BPI is at $8,650 levels. Bitcoin has appreciated by roughly 5 percent in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nStill, it's the broader context that might be most important in understanding why these small gains might tell a bigger story - BTC has now rallied more than $2,300 from Tuesday's low below $6,000.\n\nMeanwhile, other crypto market leaders have also witnessed solid gains in the last 24 hours. Ripple's XRP token has jumped 30 percent (this figure was as high as 50 percent) and was last seen changing hands at $1.10.\n\nMeanwhile, cardano and neo are also in the green, while ethereum's ETH token is reporting a solid 5 percent appreciation.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase and Ripple.\n\nMarkets image via Shutterstock"
