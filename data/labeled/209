February 20 will see the release of Montecrypto: The Bitcoin Enigma, a puzzle game that has a unique selling point; it can make you rich. Gem Rose Accent will offer a bitcoin to the first player to solve all of its puzzles. Although the value of bitcoin is dropping rapidly, this is still an interesting proposition as, at the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is still valued around £7,167 / $9,800 / €7,844 per bitcoin..

The game is community-based, so you can choose to follow clues that other players have left behind but you'll need to be careful as some clues might be misleading on purpose. You can pre-order Montecrypto: The Bitcoin Enigma on Steam at a discounted price ahead of launch. Whether that's an investment worth making we'll let you decide, but it's certainly a clever marketing gimmick if nothing else..
