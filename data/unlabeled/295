"LONDON, February 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\n\nIt's no secret that crypto incubators and hedge funds get access to the best deals because of their inside connections. But, now, for a short time there is a way for regular investors to ride on the coat tails of one of the most connected teams in crypto. Right in your brokerage account. Included in today's commentary: Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT), Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC), Nvidia Corporation (NYSE: NVDA).\n\nIn short: The team behind Global Blockchain Technologies (BLOC; BLKCF) could be one of the best ways to play the crypto boom.\n\nThe company is the world's first blockchain private equity fund, an incubator for new crypto up-and-comers.\n\nMost importantly, it's overseen by the co-founder of Ethereum, Steven Nerayoff.\n\nHe's as connected as they come... and helped Ethereum go from zero to over $100 BILLION.\n\nNot only does the Global Blockchain team invest in the best, brightest and most profitable crypto projects. It also incubates new and upcoming crypto and blockchain firms.\n\nBlockchain technology is set to revolutionize every major industry. It's time for smart investors to pay attention and Global Blockchain (BLOC; BLKCF) is the perfect place to start.\n\n#1 How Does Global Blockchain Get the Blockchain Projects?\n\nBlockchain technology is used in the crypto-currency world. It allows cryptos to bypass traditional middle-men (banks, financial firms, hedge funds) and sets up secure, linked interactive collaborative networks for the quick and easy flow of information and money.\n\nBitcoin may be a bubble, but blockchain is going to disrupt everything. In financial services alone it's being applied in brokerages, exchanges, merchants, middleware... and much more.\n\nGlobal Blockchain gives investors exposure to this booming industry. The company has built a basket of crypto-currency and blockchain investments.\n\nThe company's team of blockchain experts choose 12 or more crypto-currency tokens to incubate and will take equity and a percentage of the founder's tokens in return.\n\nIn some cases, the only way to get access to the value of these tokens early is to invest in Global Blockchain. The team at Global Blockchain knows the token world inside and out.\n\nSteve Nerayoff was a senior adviser for the crypto-currency Ethereum when it was first launched: since then, the currency has risen 94,000 percent. Nerayoff also designed the Ethereum crowdsale, which funded the project, and went on to advise Lisk crypto-currency, now with a market cap of $526 million.\n\nPresident Shidan Gouran is a blockchain expert with a long track record of spotting successful crypto-currencies.\n\n#2 They Make the Investments\n\nLast year, crypto-currencies and blockchain stocks burst on to the scene, taking investors by surprise. Now, everyone wants to get in on the action.\n\nBut investing in crypto currencies can be dangerous. Different coins are highly volatile, and values can change in the blink of an eye.\n\nGlobal Blockchain (BLOC; BLKCF) invests in a basket of holdings in the Blockchain space, giving it smart exposure to the entire sector.\n\nIn return for incubating specific tokens, Global Blockchain receives equity, allowing it to profit down the line as the token picks up value.\n\n#3 The BLOC Strategy\n\nRight now, some very large crypto-currency tokens are hogging the spotlight.\n\nBitcoin has a market cap of $157 billion, while Ethereum comes in at $109 billion and Ripple at $38 billion.\n\nBut there's still lots of room for growth. The amount of the world's wealth held in crypto-currency is very, very small: less than 0.5 percent.\n\nWhile these larger, more expensive cryptos get all the attention, there's real potential in medium and small cap tokens.\n\nSmaller coins bring higher returns. Verge, a crypto with a market cap of $864 million, has delivered a ROI of 203,049 percent to its investors.\n\nOther tokens, like PIVX, Einsteinium, ReddCoin and Stellar are also high earners: they've all brought ROIs of more than 10,000 percent.\n\nIn fact, the average price gains from the top ten small-cap tokens is more than 30,000 percent!\n\nGlobal Blockchain (BLOC; BLKCF) goes after these types of small cap currencies.\n\nAnd the insights of the company's team gives them the experience to choose the tokens most likely to have success, sifting through the hundreds of small cap tokens.\n\n#4 Securing Start-Ups\n\nGlobal Blockchain (BLOC; BLKCF) has also positioned itself as an incubator for token start-ups.\n\nAs the only \"crypto hedge fund\" in the business, it can get in on the ground floor with tokens before they reach the ICO stage.\n\nFor example: Global Blockchain was one of the first buyers of Kodak Coin, a brand-new token from the legendary camera and film company.\n\nGlobal Blockchain was offered 8 million KodakCoins as part of a pre-ICO sale, which the company secured at a huge discount for only $2 million.\n\nIn connection to its KodakCoin investment, Global Blockchain is partnering with Overstock.com and its subsidiary tZero to facilitate the KodakCoin ICO.\n\nWith tZero setting up a secure platform for KodakCoin, which will make the token more readily available and compliant with SEC regulations, Global Blockchain is to provide advisory services.\n\nThe platform will provide a secure way to facilitate ICOS in a way that is regulated and secure.\n\nAnd with each innovation, BLOC stock ticks higher and higher.\n\n#5 Major Opportunity\n\nThe crypto market realized huge gains in 2017. And it's just getting started.\n\nLarge cap tokens like Ethereum, small-caps like Verge, and start-up ICOs like KodakCoin are revolutionizing the international financial system.\n\nAnd Global Blockchain (BLOC; BLKCF) is one company that has the expertise, the strategy and tools available to make that value accessible for the investor.\n\nThe exposure gained from Global Blockchain's diverse portfolio and its stake in new crypto start-ups allows it to offer opportunities that investors can find nowhere else.\n\nDon't miss out on the blockchain revolution... especially when you can get exposure to experience, tokens and projects with one simple stock investment in Global Blockchain (BLOC; BLKCF).\n\nBy.
