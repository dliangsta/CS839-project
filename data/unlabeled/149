The Futures Industry Association (FIA) complained at the time that the high volatility of bitcoin could create financial risks for clearing houses that hadn't properly been assessed or consulted on.\n\nECB board member Yves Mersch last week warned of the \"growing risks of contagion and contamination of the existing financial system\" by cryptocurrencies.\n\nBut Damak and his team write: \"If the value of cryptocurrencies dropped substantially, we expect retail investors would endure most of the impact.\" S&P suggested that a price crash could be likely as the market has \"many characteristics of a traditional bubble.\"\n\nThe president of the World Bank, the head of the Bank for International Settlements, and the ECB's Mersch have all likened bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme in recent weeks.\n\nDespite playing down the importance of cryptocurrencies, S&P is bullish on the prospects for blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBlockchain technology, also known as distributed ledger tech, allows for a shared database that is near instantly updated, meaning all parties can see the same version. It uses complex cryptography and group authentication to police the editing of the ledger.\n\nDamak and his team wrote: \"Blockchain technology... could be a positive disrupter for various financial value-chains. If widely adopted, blockchain could have a meaningful and lasting impact on the celerity, traceability. and cost of financial transactions.\"\n\nThey added: \"The creation of a cryptocurrency backed by a central bank that gives citizens direct access to this central bank's ledger is potentially a game-changer to banks as we know them. This does not mean that banks will disappear but it would mean significant changes in the way they do business.\""
