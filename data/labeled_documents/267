News earlier this month that a group of developers are planning to hard fork the Litecoin network for the first time to form "Litecoin Cash" on Feb. 19, 2017 sparked enthusiasm amongst traders. Price increases are also attributable to traders likely 'stocking up' on LTC in order to benefit from the forthcoming 'airdrop' of Litecoin Cash tokens..

PSA: The Litecoin team and I are not forking Litecoin. Any forks that you hear about is a scam trying to confuse you to think it's related to Litecoin. Don't fall for it and definitely don't enter your private keys or seed into their website or client. Be careful out there! https://t.co/qXbiIxp5Al -- Charlie Lee [LTC] (@SatoshiLite).
