"A small toy figure is seen on representations of the Bitcoin virtual currency in this illustration picture, December 26, 2017.Reuters/Dado Ruvic\n\nFor two years, I had owned a cryptomining machine and never even known it.\n\nI currently have two of the most powerful graphics cards you can buy at the moment - the GTX 1080, which I then upgraded to the GTX 1080 Ti - which just so happen to be some of the best graphic cards for cryptomining.\n\nCryptomining is basically the process of solving complex problems to verify digital transactions using computer hardware -- in this case, a graphics card. By mining, miners can either create a cryptocurrency, or they can get paid for their processing power in a cryptocurrency.\n\nThose graphics card cost me a pretty penny, even if I bought them before the massive graphics card price hikes caused by cryptominers buying up all the cards. And when I wasn't gaming, my GTX 1080 and GTX 1080 Ti just lay there, doing nothing, not making me money.\n\nNo more. One day, I randomly decided to try mining cryptocurrency with them.\n\nI was making some profit at first, but not very much. So I got curious. What if I added more graphics cards? How much could I make?\n\nCheck out my new messy mining rig experiment to see how much bitcoin I'm making:"
