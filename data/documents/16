"Wednesday, 7 February 2018 ()\n\nThe North American Crypto Currency Conference, or NAC3 for short, will be expanded in 2018 following the success of last year's event in Las Vegas. Two events are planned: one in New York on Feb. 24 and 25 at the Sheraton in Times Square, and another in Los Angeles a month later, on March 24 and 25, at Playa Studios. Described by organizer and founder Andy Crane as the only bitcoin and blockchain conference designed for \"the average person,\" NAC3 offers access to its roster of keynote speakers in a highly inclusive event that welcomes all ages and experience levels. \"NAC3 is designed for the average person in every way,\" Crane said in a statement. \"Whether you're a total beginner or a seasoned pro, you'll walk away from NAC3 with a great deal of useful and actionable information.\" NAC3 will also feature an intensive, all-day advanced trading course taught by Crypto Bud (Ivan Leon), as well as keynote presentations by Day Hay (Crypto Riot), Rob Paone (Crypto Bobby), and Nathan Leung (Cryptonauts), as well as blockchain legal expert Jason Civalleri and Polyswarm CEO Steve Bassi. Event sponsors include Polyswarm, Blockmason, Blockpass, CEX.io, and Bitcoin.com. Tickets for the New York and L.A. events are available at https://www.nac3.io. Ticket giveaway NAC3 announced it will give away more than $10,000 worth of free tickets to the New York and Los Angeles NAC3 events to ensure that everyone who wants to attend can through a special \"scholarship program.\" \"The goal is to make sure that the tickets go to students of cryptocurrency who would otherwise not be able to attend due to the ticket price, which is $247 for admission,\" the organizers said in a statement.
