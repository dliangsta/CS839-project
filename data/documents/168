"NEM is a smart asset blockchain which was built from scratch using Java script\n\nNEM is a \"smart asset\" blockchain which supports the cryptocurrency XEM.\n\nDigital currencies are dominating the world of investing following the surge in the price of Bitcoin in late 2017.\n\nNEM, or New Economy Movement, has the currency symbol XEM and was launched on March 31, 2015.\n\nAnd while most other cryptocurrencies are developed or \"forked\" from other codes, NEM was written from scratch using Java script.\n\nAround 1,500 early investors bought XEM stakes with one stake being the equivalent of 2.25million XEM coins.\n\nA blockchain is a digital ledger where all transactions created using cryptocurrencies are recorded.\n\nA \"smart asset\" blockchain allows users to customize their own blockchain creating their own specific \"smart contract\".\n\nThis means users can create places on the NEM blockchain where they can safely put their digital assets.\n\nOn February 12 NEM was priced at $0.54 (\u00a30.39).\n\nLike many cryptocurrencies, it has suffered slightly after a dramatic high at the start of 2018, when NEM's price approached $2 on January 4.\n\nIt appears that there are many sites online which offer to help people buy NEM (XEM).\n\nBut anyone thinking of investing in NEM (XEM) or another cryptocurrency should be very careful.\n\nTheir values are volatile, with the ability to plummet as quickly as they shoot up."
