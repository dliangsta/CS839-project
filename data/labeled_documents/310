Yes, the price does fluctuate. Investing in bitcoin is risky. The cryptocurrency market is very volatile. One year the bitcoin can cost a few dollars, it can go up to $1000 the next month and drop back to its initial amount a while after. If you are an active type of investor, you can make monthly purchases and sale of bitcoins, which can result in great returns. Don't forget that these investments are taxable, like all other investments out there and any earnings are going to be taxed according to your state affiliation. It depends on the income statement how the profit is going to be calculated..
