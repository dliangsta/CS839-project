Instead, S&P labels cryptos speculative instruments which offer the small pool of retail investors using them significant risk of loss and to which major banks maintain limited exposure. That means, according to S&P, a crypto market downturn would result in major losses for retail investors but with limited damage to mainstream financial markets.\n\nThat means an overarching global regulatory framework isn't likely to emerge soon.This note is a timely reminder that, despite the attention and concern cryptos are attracting, they're not yet any kind of category with which major financial institutions are engaging at scale. It's worth noting that, for most financial regulators with the power to regulate the space, their mandate focuses largely on preventing the collapse of the world's biggest FIs, such as banks, rather than protecting small groups of individual investors. As such, given that cryptocurrencies currently stand to cause little harm to global financial stability, legislating on the cryptocurrency space is likely to remain low on regulators' agendas."
