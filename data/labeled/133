Major cryptocurrency-focused venture capital firm Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead said last week that the price of bitcoin will likely surge by next week, after it rebounds from its bear market. Morehead noted that most bear markets tend to last 71 days and hence, bitcoin will be in an ideal position to surge in value in the upcoming week..
