"Mr. Lee was the first market stategist covering Bitcoin and he has warned investors for the coin's recent fall.\n\nThe co-founder of Fundsrat Global Advisors, Tom Lee is the only major Wall Street strategist focusing on Bitcoin. According to Bloomberg, he expects Bitcoin to reach new records in July. The leading cryptocurrency has been showing some recovery since the fall of 70% from its December 18 high to its February 6 low.\n\nMr. Lee has warned the investors to pay attention during Bitcoin's record bull run. He claimed that Bitcoin has established a pattern that its bottoms appear as a V-shape. Also, he stated that since 2010, the cryptocurrency has experienced 22 corrections of 10%.\n\nFurther, Mr. Lee told that during the coin's bull runs, it takes 1.7 times the decline's duration in order to recover. Depending on that pattern, Bitcoin will need 85 days for recovering from its last fall that lasted for 50 days. In the case Tom's analysis is correct, the coin will set new highs by midyear.\n\nInvestors' sentiment about Bitcoin improved in the last weeks, resulting in investor bullishness, according to Mr. Lee. When the big decline set in Late December, Tom raised his Bitcoin price expectation to $20,000 from $11,500 for midyear.\n\nFinally, Mr. Lee told the growth of the new Bitcoin wallets caused the bull run and Fundsrat was buying Bitcoin as the price was dropping. Lee remained to his $25,000 Bitcoin price target for 2022 according to GBTC (Bitcoin Investment Trust).\n\nTom Lee was also the chief equity strategist of J.P. Morgan Chase from 2007 to 2014. Then, he helped the launching of Fundstrat and became the first market strategist to cover Bitcoin's price back in July. Now, he is the managing partner and research head of Fundstrat."
