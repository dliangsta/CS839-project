"Monday, Feb. 19: the Bitcoin price has surpassed $11,000 twice since Sunday as bullish sentiment returns to markets and new support begins to form.\n\nData from Cointelegraph's price index shows a BTC/USD journey to a high of $11,190.10 Feb. 18, followed by a smaller peak above the significant barrier Monday at $11,001.45.\n\nOptimism is flowing after Bitcoin broke through resistance surrounding $10,000 Feb. 16, the threshold subsequently forming a support floor with prices staying above it as of press time.\n\nThe move upwards broadly reflects predictions by well-known cryptocurrency price analyst Tone Vays, who in various recent forecasts warned of volatility around $10,000 and a repositioning of support floors.\n\nNow, \"clear\" support and resistance will make future price action \"more predictable\" going forward, he says, noting the \"bullish\" trend in both daily and weekly charts as the week begins.\n\n#Bitcoin hit resistance for a swift $800 drop from $11,250 to $10,400... Now that it's pulling back up what should be expect? $BTCUSD should become more predictable once clear Support & Resistance are established.
