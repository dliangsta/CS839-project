As Bitcoin observed a steady recovery, Yves Mersch, European Central Bank executive board member, issued a warning during his speech in Paris that Bitcoin is a speculative digital asset, Market News International reported. These currencies are devoid of any trusted issuer and hence, will become worthless at any point in time, he added. There is no surprise that these digital currencies are not accepted widely as means of payment, he further said. Nouriel Roubini, the famous American economist who rightly predicted the housing crash of 2008 in the US, had termed Bitcoin mania as mother of all bubbles that will burst anytime soon..
