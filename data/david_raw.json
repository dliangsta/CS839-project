["Wall Street is known for being a cut throat place where shrewd business people play as tough as possible in order to make gains or their destroy opponents. However, the crypto ecosystem can be at times far more nasty than any other market. One company that had the audacity to rate everyone's favorite cryptocurrency somewhat poorly learned this recently, but it still stands by the rankings.\n\nWeiss Ratings, an independent U.S. rating agency which recently issued letter grades for cryptocurrencies has published a new report to explain its decision to score bitcoin a mere C+ (\"fair\").\n\nThe company obviously felt it needed to counter attack against critics after its rankings caused it to get hurled insults from many cryptocurrency people and opinion leaders on social media. It even suffered a cyber attack which took down the Weiss site temporarily. The 14-page report is meant to answer the outcry by revealing key factors and data behind the rating.\n\n\"For investors,\" explains Weiss Ratings founder Martin D. Weiss, PhD, \"an A rated crypto would be one that rarely crashes, and right now, there's no such thing. But we do understand where developers are coming from. They tell us they don't care about market fluctuations. They feel our ratings should reflect strictly the quality of their work and its relative success in the real world.\"\n\nAiming to address both investors and developers, the Weiss model combines a number of sub-models: Risk and Reward, adapted from its stock and ETF ratings, plus Fundamentals and Technology, which are unique to cryptocurrencies. Here's how they determined bitcoin performs on each:\n\nRisk and Reward-\"Bitcoin investors have recently made less than altcoin investors, while continuing to experience the risk of extreme volatility.\"\n\nFundamentals-\"Due credit is given for adoption and security, but Bitcoin loses points on network congestion with just four transactions per second and high fees of about $10 per transaction. In addition, the top five miners control some 70% of total hashpower, also a negative.\"\n\nTechnology-\"Bitcoin lacks the governance needed for prompt upgrades and is falling behind in a rapidly evolving industry.\"\n\nAnother criticism that was leveled at the agency is that Weiss overweights price volatility. \"Not so,\" he says. \"Our model accurately reflects an inconvenient truth about the market's extreme swings. But our ratings are continually updated. If prices stabilize or speed enhancements are rolled out successfully, an upgrade is possible.\"", "China will reportedly block anyone in the country from accessing websites that offer cryptocurrency trading services or initial coin offerings (ICOs). Advertisements relating to Bitcoin and other virtual currencies have also been scrubbed from search engines and social media in the country.\n\nThe authorities in China have already banned ICOs and shut down domestic exchanges, but that didn't solve the issue of people accessing foreign services within the country.\n\nNow, according to local media, China will block access to domestic and foreign services \"to prevent financial risk.\" China has a long tradition of blocking unwanted foreign websites using the so-called Great Firewall of China.\n\n\"Overseas transactions and regulatory evasion have resumed,\" said an article published Sunday night by the People's Bank of China-affiliated Financial News, as quoted by the South China Morning Post. \"Risks are still there, fueled by illegal issuance, and even fraud and pyramid selling.\"\n\nThe central bank reportedly said it would \"tighten regulations\" on Chinese people's participation in overseas cryptocurrency transactions and ICOs. According to SCMP, cryptocurrency ads have also now vanished from the Baidu search engine and the social media platform Weibo, much as recently happened with Facebook.\n\nICO: Everything You Need to Know\n\nNot to be confused with an IPO.\n\nThe latest Chinese news comes at a shaky point for Bitcoin. Having slid below the $8,000 mark on Friday, Bitcoin recovered slightly before falling again through Sunday and Monday. The price at the time of writing is $7,986.\n\nApart from regulatory moves around the world, the latest development spooking the market is the decision by major U.S. banks to ban the use of their credit cards for cryptocurrency purchases. The U.K.'s Lloyds Banking Group followed suit on Monday.", "The price of a single bitcoin briefly crossed $10,000 yesterday as details emerged about a mysterious buyer's bet on the cryptocurrency. (See also: Bitcoin Price Topped $10,000 Amid Cryptocurrency Rally.)\n\nAccording to a tweet, a bitcoin address bought almost $1 billion worth of bitcoin during a dip in its prices recently. The buyer first bought bitcoin worth $344 million between February 9 and February 12, when its price traversed the range between $8,500 and $8,900. The buyer doubled down on bitcoin by purchasing 41,000 coins, just before its price hit $10,000.\n\nThe tweet will provide further ammunition to critics of the cryptocurrency. In the past, detractors have noted that despite bitcoin's claims of being decentralized, its price is susceptible to being manipulated by \"bitcoin whales,\" or investors and traders who hold large stashes of the virtual currency.\n\nMeanwhile, noted cryptocurrency analyst Tom Lee, who has a $25,000 price target for bitcoin by the end of this year, has predicted a bump in its prices starting in July.\n\n\"In general, we see 2018 being a strong year but we see the larger and more established blockchains growing in dominance in 2018 - hence better upside for ETH and BTC over the FS CryptoFX indices,\" he wrote.\n\nAmong the top 10 most-traded cryptocurrencies, bitcoin cash was the biggest gainer and moved up by 11.32% from its price 24 hours ago. After rallying for two days, crypto markets mostly moved sideways this morning. At 15:11 UTC, they had a total market cap of $481 billion, up from $468 billion earlier this morning.\n\nAs the original cryptocurrency, bitcoin's price has mostly correlated with other coins. Or so it is assumed. According to analysis by Bloomberg, bitcoin's price correlation with other cryptos \"broke down\" when it rallied. But a fall in crypto prices re-established the lockstep movement.\n\nIn quantitative terms, bitcoin's price had a correlation of 0.57 with other cryptocurrencies when prices tumbled. When they rose, it declined to 0.19. A correlation of 1 translates to synchronous movements. This is interesting analysis for traders interested in diversifying their funds away from bitcoin towards other coins.

Joyce emphasized the need to better understand the cryptocurrency's risks and benefits before moving forward with any sort of regulation: \"I think we're still absolutely studying and understanding what the good ideas and bad ideas in that space are,\" he said when asked about the potential for government regulation. \"So, I don't think it's close.\"\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized and digital, and unlike fiat currencies such as the dollar it's not backed by a central authority. And as transactions are anonymous, the coin has been accused of making it easier for those engaged in illicit activities to hide their money. But this ability that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offer to avoid traditional restrictions on money and assets is part of what makes it so popular to those who use it. That decentralization is also much of the reason its price swings so wildly.\n\n\"We are worried. There are benefits to the Bitcoin concept -- digital cash, digital currencies,\" Joyce said. \"But at the same time, if you look at the way Bitcoin works after there is a criminal act that takes place, you can't rewind the clock and take back that currency.\" Joyce described the inherent problem with this lack of a trail, noting that in the case of credit card theft, for instance, individuals or companies can contact their banks and purchases can be undone and the cash retrieved.", "The first player to beat the PC game \"MonteCrypto: The Bitcoin Enigma\" will be awarded one whole bitcoin.\n\nAt the time of writing, a single bitcoin is priced at around $US10,100 - though, given the wild swings in bitcoin's price, who knows what it will be worth when the game officially comes out on February 20th.

If not gift giving, many take the weeklong holiday to vacation and travel.\n\nGiven that so many chose Bitcoin to grow their financial coffers, many have plenty of extra of money to spend thanks to the crypto's meteoric rise in 2017. There is a train of thought that so many crypto holders cashed out of their investments to have money to buy gifts that it caused Bitcoin's price to tumble.\n\nIt's interesting that Chinese New Year spending can be correlated with Bitcoin's price crash because so many were cashing out their positions. While that's slightly plausible, it cannot be chalked up to be the main culprit behind Bitcoin's price fall.

The organizers then quickly sell their holdings of that token - the \"dump\" - and make a profit at the expense of other investors.\n\n\"The price falls and victims are left with currency or tokens that are worth much less than what they expected,\" the CFTC said in its statement.\n\nThe CFTC has been expanding its reach over cryptocurrencies, having authorized two large U.S. exchanges to list bitcoin futures late last year.\n\nAt a Senate hearing this month, CFTC Chairman Christopher Giancarlo noted that the regulator was focused on cracking down on manipulation of cryptocurrency markets.\n\n\"What we will do and we are doing is looking for fraud and manipulation,\" Giancarlo said. \"And we intend to be very aggressive.\"", "Moody's - CME Group Inc. (CME, Aa3 stable) and Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe, Baa1 positive) recent launch of Bitcoin Futures contracts is not anticipated to affect the creditworthiness of either entity, owing to strong risk management at central counterparty clearing houses (CCPs), low futures' volumes and the futures' exchanges conservative approach to managing Bitcoin exposure, Moody's Investors Service says in a new report. The price volatility of Bitcoin presents risk management challenges for CCPs which makes it more difficult to close out a defaulting clearing member's exposures. To manage this risk, both CME and Cboe set relatively high margins for Bitcoin futures trades to mitigate counterparty exposure, and have increased margin requirements from those they first presented to regulators in October 2017. \"We expect the CME and Cboe to make conservative adjustments to these margins in response to changing market conditions -- namely, a sudden rise in the volatility of Bitcoin prices -- as a risk and credit control measure,\" Moody's Analyst Fadi Abdel Massih says. Risk is contained for retail brokers as well.\n\nThe firms that offer the products, such as TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (TD Ameritrade, A2 stable) and E*TRADE Financial Corp. (E*TRADE, Baa3 review for upgrade) maintain conservative policies and margining to account for Bitcoin's high price volatility. The cautious approach from retail brokers includes pre-qualification for customers to trade Bitcoin futures as well as an adherence to high margins. This risk management tool protects the brokers' exposure at the clearing house in a scenario where a customer defaults on a position. \"The margin that a broker requires from its customers is typically at least 10% more than the margin required by the clearing house from the broker, an important risk mitigation,\" Massih says.\n\nHowever, operational risk is introduced to the underlying price of future contracts due to the use of unseasoned cryptocurrency spot exchanges. CME and Cboe use different methodologies to determine the reference rate for Bitcoin futures, and they both rely for price discovery on newly established cryptocurrency exchanges that have historically lacked meaningful regulatory oversight.\n\nPowered by Capital Market - Live News", "Ripple has signed partnerships with the central banks of England and Saudi Arabia. GEOFFROY VAN DER HASSELT/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"I try not to check [cryptocurrency prices] more than once a day,\" Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, commented on the wild fluctuations of cryptocurrencies lately in an interview with Bloomberg on Wednesday after the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco.\n\nLike many cryptocurrency advocates' unconvincing views on the matter, Garlinghouse said digital currencies are an emerging asset class that should be treated as a long-term investment rather than speculative gambling.\n\n\"At its core, all of this comes down to if we are solving real problems for real customers. If the cryptocurrency market overall or a digital asset is solving a problem, it's going to drive some value,\" Garlinghouse said.\n\nThe problem that Ripple is trying to solve is cross-border payments.\n\nCurrently, most cross-border transactions take at least two business days to complete.\n\n\"Today, when you are moving money, say from San Francisco to Paris, it's literally faster to buy an airplane ticket to fly it over there than it is to use the corresponding banking system,\" he said.\n\nWith Ripple currencies, or XRP, cross-border transactions can be completed within three seconds.\n\nAs such, it's not surprising that Ripple, in stark contrast with rival cryptocurrency companies, highly values its relationships with governments and central banks. The central banks of England (The Bank of England) and Saudi Arabia (Saudi Arabia Monetary Authority) have both signed partnerships with Ripple to install its blockchain software to process international transactions.\n\nLast week, Ripple sealed a deal with LianLian, one of China's largest digital wallet companies.\n\nThat's why Garlinghouse is an advocate for more regulation on the cryptocurrency market.\n\n\"I hope there's more regulation,\" he said. \"If we want this whole asset class to grow up and mature, of course there should be more regulation.\"\n\n\"Some of the bitcoin community come from that kind of anarchistic, libertarian view. But, one reason why I think Ripple has been very successful is because we work with the system,\" he added.\n\nThat said, the dollar price for Ripple has been on the same roller coaster ride as Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past few months. After rising more than 1,000 percent in December 2017, Ripple has lost two-thirds of its value since the beginning of this year.", "The price of Bitcoin appears to be recovering well from the dramatic fall it experienced at the end of last year. The cost to buy a single unit of the world's most popular cryptocurrency reached a two week high on Thursday, topping out at just above the $10,000 point. The second time passing, the five-digit psychological barrier seemed to offer little resistance as the price barely paused between $9,000 and the two week high.\n\nThe recent price surge seems largely driven by various news events clearing the fear and uncertainty surrounding the space of late. So far in 2018, doubt was cast over the market thanks to South Korea's musing over a cryptocurrency ban. The government there had mentioned the possibility of them taking such a harsh step but have since stated that there is no intention to eradicate the crypto-craze that's been sweeping the nation for some time. One report suggests that instead of the government there are others seeking to license cryptocurrency exchanges. This would serve to further legitimise the industry, as well as making the environment safer for investors.\n\nElsewhere, the latest round of SEC Senate hearings about Bitcoin is doing their fair share to dispel the doubt about cryptocurrencies that's been creeping in since late December. During the hearing, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Christopher Giancarlo, said:\n\n\"We owe it to this new generation to respect their enthusiasm for virtual currencies, with a thoughtful and balanced response, and not a dismissive one.\"\n\nWhat's good news for Bitcoin is usually good news for the entire space. This was highlighted by similar gains across all major cryptocurrencies. Many within the top 20 by market cap have seen price leaps between two and 25 percent in the last 24 hours. This is according to industry price website Coinmarketcap.\n\nMeanwhile, Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors believes that the price per BTC should exceed the previous all-time high by July of this year. The longtime Bitcoin advocate noted in a report earlier today that during \"bull\" periods of upward trends, Bitcoin recoveries take 1.7 times the amount of time the initial decline lasted for. For Lee, this \"implies that 85 days are needed to recover prior highs -- this is July 2018.\" His end of 2018 price call remains $25,000.\n\nMati Greenspan, senior market analyst of eToro, spoke to CNBC via phone interview about the recent breakout of prices:", "Bitcoin bulls arguing that the popular cryptocurrency could surpass gold as a flight to safety investment have gotten some discouraging market feedback in the past several weeks. When the S&P 500 experienced its largest sell-off in years this month, it coincided with bitcoin's lowest price dip in months, indicating investors don't yet see cryptocurrency as a safe way to preserve value.\n\nThe numbers suggest that the GBTC bitcoin fund does have a relatively low 0.07 correlation with the SPY ETF. In fact, the GBTC ETF has even less of a correlation to stocks than the GLD ETF, which has a negative 0.19 correlation. The negative correlation likely comes in part by the fact that investors tend to buy gold on days of market weakness.\n\nThose arguing for bitcoin being its own asset class would point to the fact that the GBTC has very low correlation to stocks, gold, oil, treasury bonds or even market volatility, according to the table.\n\nUnfortunately, there's one key component of a safe haven investment that bitcoin is sorely lacking -- stability. Traders use a metric called average true range (ATR) to determine daily asset volatility.\n\nOver the past 14 days (as of Feb. 13), amid all the stock market turmoil, the ATR of the SPY ETF as a percentage of its trading price has been about 1.7 percent, according to Stockcharts.com. In that same period, the ATR of the GLD as a percentage of its share price has been a relatively stable 0.8 percent. The ATR of the GBTC as a percentage of its share price, however, has been an incredibly volatile 14.2 percent.\n\nWith a volatility that high, investors simply can't feel safe in bitcoin-related investments in the near-term, even if the cryptocurrency has near zero correlation with stock prices. For now, bitcoin traders can feel good knowing that the stock market doesn't appear to be influencing bitcoin prices in any major way. But stock investors will likely stick to the relative stability of gold and other traditional safe-haven plays until the cryptocurrency market settles down.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nGoldman Sachs Predicts The Current Generation Of Cryptocurrencies Likely Won't Survive", "The largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, is releasing a PayPal-like service of its own.\n\nOn Wednesday, Coinbase wrote about its new platform that will make it easier for merchants to accept payments with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin through Coinbase Commerce.\n\nUsing the platform on an e-commerce website adds a PayPal-like button to the checkout screen.\n\n\"Coinbase Commerce can be directly integrated into a merchant's checkout flow or added as a payment option on an e-commerce platform,\" the blog post continued.\n\nShopify, which allows users to launch their own online stores, is already giving its users the option to accept payments via Coinbase Commerce.\n\nSome cryptocurrency aficionados immediately took to the platform.\n\nStill, don't expect a mass surge of merchants gearing up to accept cryptocurrency.

The volatile price of Bitcoin, for instance, has made it difficult to nail down a price on payments. Gaming platform Steam cited that as an issue when it stopped accepting cryptocurrency.\n\nCoinbase is not the only company with such a platform. Bitpay, which is used by Microsoft, also makes a cryptocurrency payments program -- though notably, it only accepts Bitcoin.\n\nCoinbase's announcement comes at a time when the firm itself is having issues with payments.

The advance takes prices into monthly open resistance and while prices may be vulnerable here near-term the broader outlook remains constructive.\n\nTechnical Outlook: Ripple prices are up over 100% off the February lows with the advance now testing monthly open resistance at 1.1407. An ascending pitchfork formation extending off the January lows keeps the focus higher while above near-term support at ~9646 where the 100-day moving average converges on the 50-line.

Get started with this Free Beginners Guide\n\nNotes: A closer look at Ripple price action sees the cryptocurrency breaking above basic trendline resistance extending off the record highs late-last week with a pullback and defense of this slope further validating the near-term breakout. Interim resistance targets eyed at 1.2203 backed by the median-line / 61.8% extension at 1.2956 - a breach there would be needed to fuel the next leg higher in price with such a scenario targeting subsequent resistance objectives at 1.5457 backed closely by 1.6177.\n\nBottom line: The immediate advance looks a bit vulnerable here but the broader focus remains weighted to the topside while above the monthly / yearly low-day close. From a trading standpoint, I'll favor fading weakness into structural support OR buying a break and retest of the median-line (1.2956) as support for a move back towards the 1.6177.\n\nFor a complete breakdown of Michael's trading strategy, review his Foundations of Technical Analysis mini-series\n\n- Written by Michael Boutros, Currency Strategist with DailyFX", "Up another 7% today, Bitcoin has pushed all the way to $10,150.\n\nHas the crypto become just another risk asset?

World first 0% edge games attract demand for Zerocoin, because of this, its value rises. Players can play 0% games while Zerocoin price rises. Simply put, the ultimate solution to the problem is creating a platform where playing games is \"free\". Players are not required to pay any fixed amount of money to be able to play at the casino. This can only be achieved by creating a closed loop economy with its own token where players purchase the token with fiat or crypto. Since the supply of ZERO is limited, its value is directly proportional to demand.\n\nBlockchain & Smart contract technology allows to create a fully transparent and truly fair gambling environment where players have more opportunities to participate, can completely trust the platform, and have a real chance of winning while at the same time being a part of a bigger community which fosters social inclusion and mutual values.\n\nZero Edge is introducing its own unique cryptocurrency known as Zerocoin, the only way that gamblers will be able to participate in true 0% house edge online casino games through the Zero Edge online casino network. The value of Zerocoin is set to rise rapidly, as more and more people flock to Zero Edge to enjoy true 0% house edge games.\n\nThis is also the perfect opportunity to learn about the pre-ICO or Initial Coin Offering which is set to start on the 28 of February 2018, closing out on the 15 of March 2018.

The idea of the token is to act as a bridge between international bank transactions, not to become an alternative for fiat currencies. The majority of ripple tokens are held by the parent company, meaning that it can regulate their price.\n\nRipple is often criticized by cryptocurrency enthusiasts, who say XRP undermines the whole idea of digital assets being deregulated and decentralized.

It still remains far off its all-time highs of over $19,000 reached just before Christmas.\n\nIt's hard to pin an exact reason on bitcoin's recent form.

On Tuesday, CEO Hikmet Ersek told analysts that Western Union is experimenting with Ripple and XRP for settling transactions and for capital optimization. The move comes a month after Ripple's dealings with rival company Moneygram, which was also testing XRP transfers.\n\nRipple has made more progress with partners than any other cryptocurrency. Just last week, it signed a deal with foreign exchange giant UAE Exchange, and it has also made moves into the Chinese online shopping market. The Asian arm of the company, SBI Ripple Asia, has made a lot of headway with Japanese and South Korean banks in adopting blockchain solutions for money transfers.\n\nRipple has two primary products: xCurrent, which over 100 financial institutions are currently using, and xRapid, which is based on XRP. This is the one that Western Union is now testing. A Ripple spokesperson tells Yahoo Finance:\n\nWe've been testing different products with Western Union for a while. We're excited about our work towards a pilot implementation of xRapid, which uses XRP in payment flows.\n\nWestern Union CTO Sheri Rhodes told media:\n\nWe continue to explore possible blockchain applications for our business, and we are piloting some settlement tests with Ripple for certain corridors.

Payments from the cryptocurrency exchanges to the credit cards, however, are going to be processed.\n\nClients of these two institutions will still continue using the debit cards or their transaction accounts in order to purchase cryptocurrencies.\n\nCommBank comes out to explain why they made such a decision with the simple fact that cryptocurrencies in most cases are unregulated as well as being highly volatile in nature. We opted to make this choice since we have a strong belief that virtual currencies in most cases do not meet the minimum standard for regulation, reliability as well as reputation as compared to the currencies which we provide our customers with. Due to the dynamic and volatile nature of the virtual currency markets, its position is reviewed more often, the bank stated.\n\nCommBank becomes the first bank in Australia to put a ban on its credit card owners from purchasing cryptocurrencies; however, it isn't the first bank to do so in the whole world. It was just last week when three major banks in the United States Citi, the Bank of America & J.P. Morgan Chase did announce the same measures. The United Kingdom's Lloyds Banking Group & Virgin Money did the same thing also.\n\nThe reasons behind these decisions were the same: high price, volatile nature of cryptocurrencies & the risk of the customers getting trapped into very serious debt.

The company just reported record quarterly revenue of $2.91 billion, up 10 percent from the previous quarter, thanks partly to miners rushing to buy its GPUs, often in bulk quantities. Nvidia's executive vice president and chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said: \"Strong demand in the cryptocurrency market exceeded our expectations.\"\n\nBut the firm values its core market of gamers and understands how they tie into Nvidia's other products, such as its G-Sync monitors. Brand loyalty is another important factor -- something not usually associated with miners -- and it knows the mining craze is likely to slow down in the future.\n\nNvidia said it expected the situation to remain the same over the coming quarter but reaffirmed its commitment to gamers. \"Our main focus remains on our core market, as cryptocurrency will likely remain volatile,\" added Kress.\n\nExactly how Nvidia plans to prioritize gamers wasn't made clear. Its request that retailers limit the maximum number of GPUs they sell to each miner isn't something the company can enforce. Hopefully, more sellers will follow in the footsteps of Micro Center and reduce the price of cards that are sold for gaming purposes.\n\n\"We're working really hard to get GPUs out into the marketplace for the gamers. We're doing everything we can, but I think the most important thing is, we just got to catch up with supply,\" said Huang on an earnings call.\n\nIt's also likely that Nvidia is facing supply problems caused by GDDR5 and HBM2 memory component shortages.

Bitcoin transactions also consume a lot of electricity and it takes time to validate transactions, the economists said.\n\nBitcoin suffers dramatic price plunge in Asia\n\nRight now, bitcoin transactions are estimated to use 48 terawatt hours of energy a year, an amount which could power 4.4 million US homes, according to Digiconomist, a blog about cryptocurrencies that Lee and Martin cited in their post.\n\nCash and other traditional payment methods also offer convenience, a formidable advantage relative to cryptocurrencies, the economists said.\n\n\"Fundamentally, we wonder whether a payment method designed to function where trust in institutions is completely absent can ever be as convenient as one where trust is required, but also already exists,\" Lee and Martin wrote.\n\nBitcoin has seen its value tumble as much as 70% from a record peak near $20,000 in mid-December.", "Apple Inc. (AAPL) co-founder Steve Wozniak has sold off his bitcoin holdings. He made the announcement at the Nordic Business Forum in Sweden recently. (See also: Apple Co-founder Steve Wozniak Bought Bitcoin At $700.)\n\nAlthough he became interested in bitcoin when it was at $70, Wozniak was put off by the cumbersome process for investing in bitcoin. Instead, he bought into bitcoin when it was at $700 price levels. Considering current price levels, he must have made a tidy profit during the sale.\n\nWozniak said he bought bitcoin as an experiment. But he dumped the cryptocurrency because he did not want to worry about its erratic price movements.\n\n\"When it shot up high, I said, 'I don't want to become one of those people that watches it, watches it, and cares about the number,'\" Woz said. \"I don't want that kind of care in my life. Part of my happiness is not to have worries, so I sold it all -- just got rid of it -- except just enough to still experiment with.\"\n\nWozniak has mostly been bullish on bitcoin and blockchain. He joined the board of a fintech startup that used blockchain to develop bitcoin ATMs in 2015.\n\nAt the Money 20/20 conference in October 2017, Wozniak said bitcoin is better than gold or the U.S. dollar because it had a finite supply. According to him, gold's finite supply could be increased, if humans came up with a more efficient way to mine it. Similarly, the supply of U.S. dollars could be controlled (i.e., increased or decreased) for political reasons by a governing authority.\n\nBut bitcoin's supply was mathematically constrained to 21 million. \"Gold gets mined and mined and mined,\" he said. \"Maybe there's a finite amount of gold in the world, but bitcoin is even more mathematical and regulated and nobody can change mathematics.\"\n\nWozniak assessed bitcoin as a store of value back then and compared it to owning a house. \"Your house has value. And it is a house today, 40 years from now, it still is a house in value,\" he said. At the Nordic Business Forum, he said he expected bitcoin to become a medium of transaction next.\n\nBitcoin has come a long way from its $700 price levels. The cryptocurrency almost touched $20,000 in December 2017 on the back of online chatter and media mentions. Since the start of this year, however, it has been in a prolonged swoon and has lost almost half of its value.

The S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are both down more than 6 percent this week, wiping out gains for the year. Emerging markets stocks and currencies also plunged, while U.S. Treasuries climbed as investors fled from risky assets to safe-havens.\n\nBitcoin's supporters are quick to extol the cryptocurrency' virtues as an asset that's uncorrelated to the broader market -- independent from any single country, company or central bank -- which can serve as a haven in times of market turmoil. And while that turmoil can usually be found in Bitcoin prices and headlines, this week U.S. equities are beating the largest cryptocurrency on that field.\n\nSince the drop below $6,000, Bitcoin has been on a steady climb, causing volatility measures on the digital asset to stabilize while the sell-off in the S&P 500 triggered the biggest jump on the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index ever.\n\nThe \"do no harm\" approach to cryptocurrencies taken by U.S. regulators at a Senate hearing Tuesday sparked the rebound, while negative headlines from regulatory crackdowns in China and South Korea that have weighed on prices subsided.\n\nThe 70 percent slump from Bitcoin's high of almost $20,000 has prompted finance heavy weights to say the crypto bubble had finally popped.

(Check, flat at mid-point with margin expansion),\" Mitch Steves, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets said in a note to clients Friday.\n\nAhead of the report, some analysts were worried Nvidia would have trouble showing it could sustain growth outside of its graphics division. Cryptocurrency miners contributed about $70 million in sales during the third quarter, and Steves estimates the miners added about $180 million in sales during the fourth quarter.\n\nAMD, Nvidia's main rival in the space, said about one-third of its graphics division growth came from cryptocurrency miners, which led some investors to worry if the company would be growing without the wildly volatile cryptocurrency market. After it's earnings report, it looks like Nvidia isn't facing the same problems.\n\nThe one blip in Nvidia's stellar report came from the sluggish growth in its automotive division. Nvidia's chips for power infotainment systems and self-driving cars are off to a slow start, but the company could just be a bit too far ahead of the curve, Steves said. In a couple years, when autonomous cars become more popular and more advanced, the 3% growth will start to be a bigger problem.\n\nSteves rates Nvidia as an \"outperform\" and has a $280 price target, about 22% higher than the current price.", "Student regrets decision to feed annoying swan through his window Tom HerbertFriday 9 Feb 2018 3:15 pm Share this article with Facebook Share this article with Twitter Share this article with Google Plus Share this article through email Share this article with Whatsapp Share this article through\n\nAn exasperated student got more than he bargained for after he fed a persistent swan some bread through his bedroom window.\n\nShaka, from Enfield, London, threw the annoying bird some food after it woke him up with incessant pecking on the glass as he tried to sleep before lectures at Lancaster University.\n\nGirl, 13, filmed slapping elderly woman across face in street\n\nBut Shaka came to regret that decision after his attempt at distraction merely attracted another swan to his window.\n\nShaka said: 'This hasn't happened to me before and obviously when the flat was sold to us there was no disclaimer about swans trying to wake you up for breakfast.\n\n'At first, I thought it was someone doing construction outside and then I realised that it was a flipping swan trying to get into my room.\n\n'It continued to bite up along the window trying to get in.\n\n'When I tried to send it away its friends arrived, so I had a swan group just outside hindering my sleep, which I value very much.'\n\nEurostar is launching service from London to Amsterdam\n\nHe chronicled the entire day, which began with the animal knocking on his door before lectures.\n\nUnable to ignore the feathered pest, he threw out a few slices of bread to try and distract his unwelcome visitor, only for it to attract another swan.\n\nAfter more than two hours, the swan finally gave up and left Shaka alone only to return once he had come back from his lecture to carry on nipping at the window with his beak.\n\n'When I finished my lectures, the swan saw me go into my room and decided to come back and knock again,' he said.\n\n'Yeah, I tried to get rid of the swans by banging on the window, telling it off and eventually throwing bread but then the seagulls came and robbed the bread so that didn't work in the slightest.\n\n'I hate any type of bird unless it's chicken on a plate.'\n\nMORE: Bitcoin price fears as Hong Kong sets out cryptocurrency crackdown plan\n\nMORE: What are the rules of curling and how much do the stones weigh?", "NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) reported a strong earnings beat, but wasn't strong enough for at least one analyst to turn bullish on the stock.\n\nKeyBanc Capital Markets' Michael McConnell maintains a Sector Weight rating on Nvidia's stock with no assigned price target.\n\nNvidia's fourth quarter report consisted of a revenue beat on strong sales of GPUs to the datacenter end market, the gaming end market, and for use in cryptocurrency mining, McConnell said in a note. Gross margin of 61.9 percent came in ahead of the 59.7 percent the analyst expected due to a favorable mix of higher-margin datacenter segment sales, while a lower-than-expected tax rate also helped the company report an earnings beat.\n\nNvidia's report offset the analyst's prior concerns on growth in the gaming segment, but the company's guidance came in flat. Management guided its first quarter revenue to be $2.9 billion, which implies zero growth from the fourth quarter but 50 percent year-over-year.\n\nNvidia's valuation needs to be taken into consideration. The analyst's fair value for Nvidia's stock at $206 is based on a 25 times multiple on his new fiscal 2020 earnings per share estimate of $8.25 and implies the stock has downside potential. A bull-case scenario would value the stock at $265, while a bear-case scenario would see the stock valued at $191.\n\nShares of Nvidia were trading higher by more than 9 percent at $237.50 early Friday morning.\n\nIs Nvidia A Buy?

During an investors conference call, Jen-Hsun Huang, CEO of NVIDIA made it clear that the company is doing its level best to address the shortage, and that its focus is still set on the gamers and not the miners.\n\n\"We're working really hard to get GPUs out in the marketplace for gamers, and we're doing everything we can to advise e-tailers and system builders to serve the gamers,\" Huang had said during the conference call.\n\nNVIDIA disclosed that during the fourth quarter earnings of its 2018 fiscal year, its GPU business brought in a record revenue of US$2.46 billion (~RM9.69 billion), exceeding its initial expectations. The company, however, did hint that it was the strong GPU demand in the cryptocurrency market that contributed to this boom in revenue.\n\n\"Cryptocurrency account for a higher percentage of revenue than the previous quarter,\" Colette Kress, executive vice president and CFO, NVIDIA, mentioned during the call.\n\nTo recap, PC gamers have essentially been left in the lurch looking for an affordable GPU, and it's mainly due to cryptocurrency miners snagging up every available GPU they can get their hands on.\n\nTo make matters worse, there is also a global shortage of memory chips, which in turn has affected the production supply of graphics cards. In light of the shortage, many retailers have increased the price of all graphics cards model. Again, this has left many gamers frustrated, simply because they aren't willing to pay more than what a card is worth.\n\nFor example, a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti from any brand currently sells for RM4,000 on average, while a mid-range GPU such as the GeForce GTX 1060 and Radeon RX 480 can be purchased for an average price of RM2,000.\n\n\"We're doing everything we can, but I think the most important thing is, we just got to catch up with supply,\" Huang said. \"We're just constrained.\"", "Despite their rough entry to 2018, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are here to stay according to cyber security expert-cum-Shark Tank investor, Robert Herjavec. The 55-year-old Croatian-Canadian entrepreneur feels that digital currency is a logical replacement for the paper cash that we as a society are increasingly less dependent upon. Speaking with Time's MONEY show, the TV investor stated:\n\n\"To me, it's the wave of the future... Fast forward 25 years from now, there will be some form of a cryptocurrency that we will pay for electronically, and the concept of cash will go away one day.\"\n\nHe's also particularly optimistic about blockchain technology. For him, the backbone of digital currencies could be a real game changer to the cyber security industry he's so familiar with. He believes that decentralised data storage solutions will revolutionise the verification of business transactions:\n\n\"It's going to have massive benefits for humanity, in all kinds of transactions including cyber security.\"\n\nHowever, Herjavec isn't completely sold just yet. The investor hasn't used any of the $200 million he has behind him to take a position in any cryptocurrency just yet. He still feels its too much like the Wild West at present. He told the news outlet:\n\n\"There's no base for it... When I buy a house and it's overpriced, I can live in it. There's some fundamental value. The challenge with cryptocurrency is, it could go to zero. There's no one exchange that is making them. Exchanges that sell them now can be hacked. We recently saw the largest breach ever -- $500 million in 24 hours. If you had bought that exchange, it's not that you've gone down 20% or 40%, you've actually gone to zero.\"\n\nToday's sentiment from the businessman and investor seems to mirror that expressed to BNN last December. On Bitcoin's insane price run out at the tail end of last year, the Shark Tank personality stated:\n\n\"I really think that cryptocurrency is going to go up. It's definitely a bubble. The underlying technology, Blockchain, is here to stay.\"\n\nHe went on to display a somewhat dated and naive interpretation of the cryptocurrency economy as it exists at present:", "Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is hovering just above the $7,000 mark per coin as the digital currency market suffers one of its most widely covered and harshest sell-offs in recent history. In December, the bitcoin frenzy hit its peak with the cryptocurrency flying to record highs near the $20,000 mark. While investors may be extremely unsettled as bitcoin trades at less than half of its value of a month ago, one early crypto investor suggests that volatility is normal and that the market will stabilize this year after bitcoin regains its value.

It's quite a resilient currency/commodity/asset that just keeps going up afterwards,\" said Ran Neu-Ner, host of CNBC's \"Cryptotrader.\" \"I think 2018 is the year where the mechanisms to allow retail consumers to get into cryptocurrencies start to open themselves up ... The price will become more stable.\"\n\nLast week, Neu-Nur predicted bitcoin bottoming around $7,500, indicating that he couldn't see it going much under that due the big uptake in crypto trading, particularly highlighting \"a lot of retail money that has gone into bitcoin.\" A day after his interview on CNBC, the investor \"pinned a tweet\" forecasting bitcoin to finish this year at $50,000.\n\nNeu-Nur made his bull case based on the idea that in 2018, \"the mechanisms to allow retail consumers to get into cryptocurrencies start to open up.\" For example, he noted that Robinhood, a popular online brokerage used primarily by Millennials, started offering free bitcoin trading last week. As it becomes easier for the retail investor to start trading bitcoin, Neu-Nur expects the price of the digital currency to stabilize. He attributes bitcoin's large price swings to a market with \"not enough buyers and not enough sellers.\"\n\nThe investor also recommended buying ethereum, indicating that \"the smartest people in the world are developing on ethereum.\" While bitcoin has two use cases at max, either serving as a currency or a store of value, Neur-Nur said that ethereum is attractive as a platform for multiple uses, from hedging to betting and sports.\n\nHe sees bitcoin as more of a store of value than a currency, indicating that none of the blockchains are ready for the scale of real-world currency transactions.
