An astonishing statistic which shows just why homeownership has collapsed among this age group.\n\n'The recent changes to stamp duty rules should offer some hope for those striving to get on the ladder. But the government needs to go much further if we're to have any chance of balancing the scales again for young adults.\n\n'It's no secret that we need more investment in house building to increase the supply of affordable homes. But we also need more forward-thinking, innovative policies to address the challenges of affordability and space in the UK's cities.\n\n'The government has pumped a lot of money into demand side policies, but we must see firmer action on the supply side, if we're to house the next generation.'\n\n15:13 Bitcoin breaks through $10,000\n\nAfter hovering at the same level for much of this week Bitcoin has broken through the $10,000 mark this afternoon.\n\nThe cryptocurrency has risen 2.76% over the last 24 hours now, and is trading $10,107.50 - correcting itself after dropping to a low of $6,000 just last week.\n\n15:00 City regulator refuses to publish report into scandal-struck RBS small business unit\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has refused MP Nicky Morgan's request to publish a report into the behaviour of the Royal Bank of Scotland's Global Restructuring Group in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIn a letter to Morgan, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee investigating the scandal, the FCA said it had not gained the consent of all the people identified in the paper to publish, claiming it could not 'legally' publish to the wider public.\n\nIt is alleged the RBS arm mistreated smaller businesses and caused them financial distress and the report, which has been leaked to a number of newspapers, found workers were encouraged to charge extra fees.\n\nNicky Morgan slammed the FCA for losing control of the report and the investigation and wanted to be able to use parliamentary privilege to publish the document.\n\n14:37 Volatile early trading on Wall Street\n\nAfter looking positive this morning, US stock markets were close to opening down after trade and housing figures suggested inflationary pressures were increasing in the economy.\n\nThe Dow opened 0.06% down before shooting back into the green at 0.14% in the first few minutes of trading, shaking off the economic news.\n\n14:10 US trade numbers also surprise...\n\nUS import prices were also more positive than expected in January, but added to increasing inflationary pressures.\n\nImport prices climbed by 1% last month, compared to a 0.1% rise in December and expectations of a 0.6% increase.\n\nThe rising cost of petrol and other goods pushed the figures higher.\n\n13:58 Strength in the US housing market\n\nOver in the US - housing starts in January came in higher than expected today.\n\nUnits were 1.325m up from a revised 1.209m and higher than the predicted 1.234m.\n\n12:55 Collapsing odds of home ownership\n\nThe odds of a young adult earning an average pay packet owning their own home have 'collapsed' in the last 20 years.\n\nIn the 1990s, a worker aged between 25 to 34 had a two in three chance of owning their own property, according to a new study from the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\n\nBy 2015/16, someone in the same age bracket had just a one in four chance of getting on the property ladder.\n\nIFS director Paul Johnson shared this graph which puts the change into context...\n\nHouse prices have grown seven times faster than the incomes of young people over the last 20 years https://t.co/dOTlht1nhI pic.twitter.com/oa1mh8MtzQ -- Paul Johnson (@PJTheEconomist)\n\nFebruary 16, 2018\n\n12:38 US markets expected to keep up yesterday's gains on opening\n\nFutures trading suggests the Dow Jones will open higher again today, gaining 40 points with a rise of 0.16%.\n\nThe S&P 500 is expected to rise 0.23% higher and the tech-heavy Nasdaq is due to come in 0.29% up.\n\nYesterday Wall Street ended the day posting gains of more than 1% and the Dow rose to 25,200.37.

The big question now is whether this is the start of a worrying trend for the economy, or whether falling inflation and rising wages will come to the rescue.\n\n'The monthly data is volatile, and it's therefore hard to draw firm conclusions from two months of disappointing numbers, but it now looks certain the longer-term trend is one of slowing growth in the retail sector.'\n\nBut the Bank of England could help ease the squeeze on household budgets if a hike in interest rates leads to lower inflation rates, he adds.\n\n'The Bank of England says wage growth is on an upward trajectory, while inflation may well have peaked.\n\n'This means we could see an end to falling real wages in the coming months, which would provide a welcome fillip to cash-strapped households. Assuming pay growth figures over the next couple of months back up this theory, it still looks like the MPC will have the confidence to raise interest rates to 0.75% in May.'\n\n10:23 Pound shifts down a gear\n\nSterling has fallen after the weak retail sales update today.\n\nIt had risen to $1.41 but was back to $1.409 after the ONS update.\n\n10:14 City retail finance expert has a more optimistic update for UK retailers...\n\nRetailers should be wary of the impact interest rate rises will have on consumer spending Alex Marsh, managing director of Close Brothers Retail Finance, has said.\n\nAfter ONS figures reveal a continued slowdown in retail sales in January, Marsh released a more optimistic statement on the outlook for the high street.\n\n'Our data showed that the average spend in January was higher than in December, particularly in the first week of the month which saw purchases up 12% compared to [the average day last year.\n\n'Millennials largely drove this trend, purchasing big ticket items such as furniture or electrical gadgets.\n\n'With the Bank of England reporting a slow uptick in real wages, we may see sustained growth in sales continue into next month and beyond.\n\n'However, retailers should be cautious of consumers reducing spending in light of the interest rate rises predicted this year. In this situation, retailers who offer finance with fixed repayments can thrive by offering consumers stability and flexibility on payment options for big ticket items.'\n\n09:55 Sales in non-food stores outpacing food sales now\n\nOn average, 40p in every \u00a31 is spent in food stores while 42p is spent in non-food stores https://t.co/VJRvlO4789 pic.twitter.com/m4QGSxe8jp -- ONS (@ONS)\n\nFebruary 16, 2018\n\n09:39 Retail sales stagnant with food sales down six months in a row\n\nThe ailing UK high street has been dealt another blow with confirmation that retail sales have slumped.\n\nGrowth in sales in January this year was at its slowest since April 2017 according to the Office for National Statistics -

boosted by high demand for warehouse space as online shopping continues to grow in popularity.\n\nChief executive David Sleath said demand remained strong as warehouse space 'remains constrained'.\n\n'Investor appetite for prime warehouses remains unsated, attracted by the occupational market fundamentals,' he said.\n\nHe added: 'The structural drivers of demand in our sector (urbanisation, growth of the digital economy and e-commerce) are likely to underpin occupier demand for some time to come and these, coupled with our modern, well-located assets, our current development pipeline and our land bank all offer significant opportunities for future growth.'\n\n08:19 Today's agenda: Retail sales and US economic update\n\nNew figures revealing how retail sales have stacked up on the UK high street are due out at 9.30am today.\n\nOver in the US all eyes are on the index of export and import prices, as well as some stats on housing -
