The way John Fieschi sees it, digital currency is coming, so he may as well embrace it and integrate it into his business now.. Fieschi, who owns EZ2Drive on Federal Road in Danbury with his wife Eda, is now accepting Bitcoin as payment for the used cars on his lot and the services provided by his garage. He believes he is the first car dealer in New England and one of only a handful in the U.S. to accept cryptocurrency.. "I feel confident with the technology," Fieschi said. "I think in the next five or 10 years everyone will be using digital currency. More stores will start to accept Bitcoin soon.". The eye-catching Bitcoin sign in the window at EZ2Drive may attract the attention of passers-by, but people are not rushing in to use the currency. To date, no one has purchased a car using Bitcoin at his lot.. Bitcoin is a digital, or crypto, currency created in 2009 that is purchased and traded online. There is no bank or government behind Bitcoin as it exists entirely in the digital realm. There are no physical coins or bills as Bitcoins -- or fractions of Bitcoins -- are purchased and stored in a digital wallet on sites such as Coinbase or Mycelium.. Transactions are made from one computer or mobile device to another.. Because Bitcoin is bought online with no physical proof of purchase, has a fluctuating value and is not backed by a central bank, it is seen by many as blurring the lines between owning currency and playing the stock market. Bitcoin is listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.. Investors have ridden a roller coaster of highs and lows over the years. It topped $1,000 (the price for one Bitcoin) for the first time in January 2017 and peaked in December 2017 at nearly $20,000. Two weeks ago, Bitcoin hovered around $7,000, and on Friday afternoon it was back up to just over $10,000.. Like stocks, taxes on Bitcoin are treated like capital gains or losses.. The new bank?. Howard Schwartz, executive communications director at Connecticut Better Business Bureau, said the most important thing to keep in mind when considering owning Bitcoin is that "there is absolutely nothing backing it.". He said digital currency may be regarded more as an asset than a currency. Other forms of digital currency -- such as ApplePay or PayPal -- are backed by real U.S. dollars.. Many retailers are reluctant to accept Bitcoin as payment because of its volatility, Schwartz believes.. "Interest (in digital currency) is at an all-time high so you'd think retailers would be lining up to accept Bitcoin. But retailers are even more skeptical than consumers," he said. "What if the value drops right after the purchase? It could be worth a lot now, but it could all change overnight. Both retailers and consumers can be burned by Bitcoin.". Kenneth Weinstein, president and CEO of Newtown Savings Bank, agreed that there is hesitancy to invest in digital currency because it is new and volatile.. "It's promising technology, but at this point, it's like the Wild West," he said. "It's certainly a good attention-getting strategy (for retailers).". Fieschi thinks the day is coming soon when digital currencies will compete with banks on a global scale. Similar to other industries that have changed dramatically because of the internet, he thinks banks should be embracing digital currency and figuring how to co-exist now. Just as Kodak was slow to accept digital photography, he said, banks will suffer a similar fate if they try to stand toe-to-toe with digital currency.. "If you fight technology, you will probably lose," Fieschi said. "Banks need to adapt because technology will win out. The genie is out of the bottle and is not going back in.". Any currency, whether it is physical or digital, is only good if it is accepted as payment. That's where Bitcoin has a distinct advantage over the other cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin is accepted at only a handful of places in Connecticut, it is an option for payment on websites such as Overstock.com, Expedia and eGifter, an online gift card outlet. Microsoft accepts Bitcoin for certain online purchases.. Fieschi said a benefit of accepting Bitcoin for payment is that all transactions are irreversible and trackable. There is no need to worry about counterfeit bills, bounced checks or credit card challenges with no merit -- all of which he's seen during his years selling and fixing cars.. Bitcoin is not a currency for drug dealers and other criminals to hide their money, Fieschi said, although that is how many people think of it.. "I understand the software and cryptographs behind it. It's strong. There no way to counterfeit it," he said. "Bitcoin is not used for illegal transactions. The 'from' and 'to' are very transparent. It's all public information. That's why big companies don't like it because their competitors can see what they are doing.". Fieschi started investing in digital currency four years ago. At 47, Fieschi admits he is the "old man" in his digital currency circles.. While Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, there are more than a thousand other ones out there. Some are fairly well known, such as Litecoin and Ethereum, but many are considered potential scams, Fieschi said.. Schwartz said the Better Business Bureau and the U.S. government strongly advise potential investors of digital currency to consult a financial adviser first.. Fieschi agrees that a strong knowledge base is required before investing in cryptocurrency.. "It's a mistake to focus only on Bitcoin and ignore the others out there," Fieschi said. "You have to be careful because there are a lot of scams with new coins. Do your research carefully. It's new technology so you can be easily fooled. Try to understand it before you invest in it.".
