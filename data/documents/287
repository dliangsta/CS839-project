"In an interview with \u00c2 Business Insider, the fork's founders maintain that litecoin cash not a scam, and an improvement on the original litecoin.\u00c2\n\nLitecoin is down 2.2% Tuesday morning - alongside most other major coins - after the cryptocurrency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first hard fork, Litecoin Cash, was announced by an unaffiliated organization.\n\nLitecoin holders will receive 10 tokens of litecoin cash for every one litecoin they own, the newly minted Litecoin Cash foundation said Monday.\n\nThe goal of the new currency is to increase the \"block speed\" at which the network can process transactions. The foundation says litecoin cash has a goal block time of 2.5 minutes - faster than litecoin. Like bitcoin and most other major cryptocurrencies, but unlike the existing Litecoin network, litecoin cash will use the more energy intensive, but potentially more secure, proof-of-work mining method.\n\nThe fork will occur precisely at block 1371111. The Litecoin network is currently on block 1368028 at the time of writing, according to BlockCypher. The fork is expected to occur sometime around 9 p.m. ET on Monday, February 19.\n\nLitecoin, which was designed to be less energy intensive than bitcoin, saw an astronomical rise in 2017. The cryptocurrency skyrocketed from just $3.73 a year ago, to as high as $365 in December, leading founder Charlie Lee to warn investors about the possibility of losing everything. He also sold his entire stake after being accused of price manipulation.\n\nOne week before litecoin cash was announced, Lee tweeted a warning that any fork of litecoin was \"a scam trying to confuse you to think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s related to litecoin.\"\n\nTwitter\n\nForks aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t uncommon in the cryptocurrency world, although they are not without controversy. Bitcoin cash famously split from the flagship bitcoin in August 2017, but the forked cryptocurrency has been accused of merely riding the coattails of the more established bitcoin.\n\nLitecoin cash's founders insist that isn't the case with this new cryptocurrency.\u00c2\n\n\"As to the name, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strictly a product of convention. No confusion is intended, but it has simply become customary for a new coin arising from a fork to use the forked coin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name as a prefix to its own,\" litecoin cash's head of design Michael \"Scarlet\" Wyszynski told Business Insider.\n\n\"And while we're not affiliated with Litecoin or the Litecoin dev team in any way, we will share the first 1371111 blocks of transactions in the ledger.\u00c2 People are absolutely right to be cautious and skeptical.\""
