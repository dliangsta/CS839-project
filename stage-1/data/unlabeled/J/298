"Texas securities regulators are continuing to crackdown on unregistered companies with opaque business practices selling investments tied to cryptocurrencies.\n\nTexas Securities Commissioner Travis J. Iles issued on Feb. 2 an emergency cease-and-desist order against a company dubbed DavorCoin to stop its \"illegal and fraudulent offers of a different lending scheme,\" according to a news release. It's the fourth emergency action the Texas State Securities Board has taken against such firms, and the orders are part of the agency's \"ongoing investigation\" into the cryptocurrency market, Robert Elder, spokesman for the Texas State Securities Board, said Monday via email.\n\nBefore buying in to \"the hype surrounding cryptocurrencies\" investors should make sure they know exactly what they're investing in, Iles advised in the news release on DavorCoin.\n\n\"Promoters of fraudulent securitized cryptocurrencies are using technology in a way that conceals their identity and their actions,\" he said in the release. \"Ultimately, investors are investing in nothing more than a promise made through a website maintained by an anonymous group.\"\n\nDavorCoin is allegedly telling investors they can earn a profit by investing in a lending platform based on \"a new cryptocurrency known as davorcoin,\" the release says. An investor would purchase the davorcoin, and then lend it to the firm, the release says.\n\nBut DavorCoin didn't make it clear how it will generate profits for those who invest, the Texas State Securities Board said in its release.\n\nThe company also doesn't say who its principals are or where its place of business is, \"claiming instead that 'due to tax and regulation risks,' it 'cannot officialize its domiciliation,'\" according to the release.\n\nDavorCoin could not be reached for comment.\n\nLast month the regulators issued cease-and-desists order against Hong Kong-based R2B Coin, and United Kingdom-based BitConnect. In December regulators issued an order against Dubai-based USI-Tech.\n\nAfter BitConnect announced in January it was shutting down its \"lending and exchange platform,\" DavorCoin appeared to step up its efforts, according to the release.\n\nDavorCoin is an unregistered firm, and its affiliates, who are also unregistered, are selling securities, according to the release.\n\n\"It's a recent issue for kind of everyday Texas investors,\" Elder previously told the Express-News.\n\nThe \"volatility\" in the price of bitcoin has attracted the attention of the press and the financial marketplace, Elder said, and companies are trying to take advantage of the \"mania over price and the promise of cryptocurrencies.\"\n\n\"When they start to target specifically Texas investors through websites, Craigslist ads, YouTube channels, multi-level marketing sales strategies, when it hits that area where you see companies come out of the woodwork to try to attract Texas investors in these ways, that's when we feel we have to take action, let investors know what deficiencies these companies have,\" Elder said last month.\n\nMarketing cryptocurrency-based investments has \"exploded in recent months,\" Elder added Monday via email, \"primarily due to the attention paid to price spikes, and declines, of Bitcoin.\"\n\n\"The companies we have entered orders against are overseas entities who provide very little information about themselves,\" Elder said. \"It's not possible to tally losses.\"\n\nLast week Facebook said it had created a new policy banning ads which \"promote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices, such as binary options, initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency.\"\n\n\"There are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith,\" Facebook said.\n\nThe Texas Department of Banking also recently went after a cryptocurrency-related business in January, issuing a cease-and-desist order against AriseBank, which claimed to be a \"cryptocurrency bank.\""
