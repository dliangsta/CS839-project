"TRX is attached to a new blockchain-based technology that aims to revolutionise the way people consume entertainment\n\nAFTER Bitcoin's price exploded last year, all eyes have been on the volatile and expanding cryptocurrency market.\n\nTron, which hit the market in September 2017, is one of the newest kids on the crypto-block...\n\nLike Bitcoin, Tron is cryptocurrency which is traded online.\n\nBut unlike Bitcoin, it is attached to a new blockchain-based technology that aims to revolutionise the way people consume entertainment.\n\nTron claims to allow users to freely publish, store and own data - which can create a decentralised content distribution platform.\n\nThe company says this will allow it to undercut its centralised competitors like Google Play and Apple's App Store, which charge high fees.\n\nIt is based on the technology behind another cryptocurrency - Ethereum.\n\nTron's official cryptocurrency is called Tronix (TRX).\n\nTron has been trading since mid-September, and went from strength to strength as the hype around cryptocurrencies exploded.\n\nThe cryptocurrency was worth just $0.0021 (\u00a30.0016) for a single unit on December 5.\n\nBy January 5, though, its value had soared to over $0.25.\n\nLike other cryptoccurencies, it has suffered in recent weeks - on February 12, it is priced at $0.046 (\u00a30.03).\n\nThere are few places where you can buy TRX for real money.\n\nInstead, you need to buy Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency and trade it for TRX.\n\nYou can make this trade using an online currency exchange such as Coinnest, Binance or Liqui.\n\nAnyone thinking of investing in Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency should be very careful.\n\nTheir values are volatile, with the ability to plummet as quickly as they shoot up.\n\nAnd investors are frequently targeted by hackers and other criminals who seek to steal their crypto-cash online.\n\nBe especially careful if you are using direct, peer-to-peer platforms to sell and buy cryptocurrencies."
