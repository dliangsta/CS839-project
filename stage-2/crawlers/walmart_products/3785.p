VApple MacBook Pro with Retina displayPower adapter, Multimillion-pixel viewForth-generation Intel mobile processorIris graphicsLong-lasting batteryUltrafast all-flesh storageWi-Fi - the definition of fastThunderbolt 2FaceTime HD cameraMulti-touch trackpad and backlit keyboard, Multimillion-pixel viewWhen you pack so many pixels into a display - the results are positively stunning. The pixel density is so high, your eyes can't discern individual pixels. Images take on a new level of realism. A spectacular resolution on the MacBook Pro let you see more of your high-resolution images with pixel-for-pixel accuracy. And text is so sharp, you'll feel like you're reading email, web pages, and documents on a printed page. The Retina display reduces glare while maintaining incredible color and quality. Its high contrast ratio results in blacker blacks and whiter whites. And everything in between is rich and vibrant. IPS technology gives you a wide, 178-degree view of everything on the screen, so you'll see the difference at practically any angle. And you're going to love what you see.Forth-generation Intel mobile processorWith a fourth-generation dual-core Intel processor, the MacBook Pro with Retina display lets you take your most performance-hungry apps on the road. That means wherever you can take your camera, you can take your entire digital photo studio. Hyper-Threading technology, which enhances performance by letting each core handle multiple tasks simultaneously, is included in every model. And with high speeds, shared L3 cache and Turbo Boost speeds, these processors are ready for just about anything.Iris graphicsThe MacBook Pro with Retina display features Intel Iris graphics to handle both everyday tasks and graphics-intensive creative apps. Scroll through large photo albums with ease. Play games with amazing detail. Even connect an external display or two.Long-lasting batteryThe MacBook Pro lasts hours between charges. That's impressive battery life for any notebook. But for a high-performance notebook with an ultra-high-resolution display, state-of-the-art processors and graphics, and a superslim design, it's absolutely remarkable.Ultrafast all-flesh storageYou'll notice a difference in whatever you do - starting up takes seconds, apps launch quickly, even navigating the desktop feels incredibly fluid and responsive. It's all thanks to PCle-based flash storage with incredibly fast read and write performance. So you can import huge photo libraries in no time flat.Wi-Fi - the definition of fastMeet the ultimate mobile creative studio. With an emphasis on mobile. Equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wireless technology, you're free to unplug and still stay connected - to your network, to your wireless peripherals, and to the world. With AirPlay and Apple TV, you can wirelessly play video, show off photos, and enjoy music from your MacBook Pro on your widescreen TV.Thunderbolt 2Fast and versatile, Thunderbolt 2 provides up to 20Gb/s of bandwidth to each external device. So you're more than ready for the next generation of high-performance peripherals and displays. You can connect massive amounts of storage and add a PCI expansion chassis. And since each Thunderbolt 2 port allows you to daisy-chain up to six peripherals, you can go all out by plugging in up to 12 external devices via Thunderbolt alone.Splendid audioYou haven't heard it all until you've heard the speakers inside MacBook Pro. For something so thin and light, the sound is huge. And with a wide dynamic range, optimal balance, and a crisp, expressive quality, these speakers might sound too good to be true. That's because the design was labored painstakingly to maximize the quality of every decibel you hear. Dual built-in microphones are great for when you want to be heard. If you're making a FaceTime call, for example, the mics reduce background noise from behind the notebook. And when you use Dictation, they create an adaptive audio beam that intelligently adjusts to detect your voice - instead of the noise around you.FaceTime HD cameraCentered just above the widescreen Retina display on MacBook Pro is an advanced FaceTime HD camera, with an image sensor that produces accurate colors and reduced image noise even in low light. The sophisticated image processor produces sharper images and reduced motion blur. And the face detection feature automatically adjusts exposure and white balance to complement your face and skin tone, so you always look your best - no matter what lighting is behind you.Multi-touch trackpad and backlit keyboardIn OS X, Multi-touch is an essential part of how you interact with your Mac. Using realistic, intuitive gestures, you can switch between apps, navigate your content, and get the most out of your desktop space. MacBook Pro features a Multi-touch trackpad with a large, all-glass button surface. So you can tap, pinch, swipe, and click away comfortably. Thin and light, MacBook Pro is designed to go anywhere - including places with less-than-stellar lighting. A built-in sensor detects changes in ambient light and adjusts the keyboard and display brightness automatically. So you're never left in the dark.
