"Venezuela and cryptocurrencies make perfect bedfellows. Both are powered by magical thinking, dubiously valued and rightly viewed with suspicion. Yet Venezuela's bitcoin-esque \"petro\" still makes little sense.\n\nThe government has incubated its cryptocurrency in a haze of confusion. Information was sparse on Tuesday, the official launch date. Previously, a price of $60 price per petro had been mooted -- linked to the price for a barrel of oil -- and enough for the country to raise $6bn and avert default. But millions of tokens have been touted to global buyers at an unknown discount and no up-to-date information on pricing has been published. Having claimed that 100m units would be released, the government said Venezuela would make up to 38.4m in a presale.\n\nThe link between petros and oil is also questionable. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claims the petro will be backed by Venezuela's oil reserves, with prices to match, yet investors will not be able to swap their petros for oil. Right now, they can only buy them with hard currencies such as US dollars rather than the wrecked bol\u00edvar. This is the real plan in motion. Venezuela is dealing with quadruple digit inflation and tanking oil production. It wants dollars and needs to circumvent sanctions to get them. If petros work, expect to see a raft of cryptos from other sanctioned nations (the Myanmar yango? Cuban tobaccoin?). But this is not a given. The US Treasury has already warned that anyone silly enough to buy petros may be exposed to sanctions risk.\n\nVenezuela has a poor credit history and is in economic crisis. The petro is not the answer to these problems. But it may make the history books anyway. Cryptos were born of anti-authoritarians who sought to replace banks and states with blockchain. As cryptos gain traction, intermediaries want in. Venezuela will host one of the first intersections between cryptos and the very institutions they were designed to avoid."
