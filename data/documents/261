The feature will come in handy to users who primarily focus on trading in the same currency - especially when it comes to keeping track of profits and losses.\n\nUp until now, CoinMarketCap supported the option to list coin prices in USD, Bitcoin and Ethereum. But given the rising popularity of Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, and Litecoin, it is hardly surprising the company has opted to extend its options.\n\nTo take advantage of the new functionality, click on the blue button at the middle top of CoinMarketCap's price listings and select your preferred currency.\n\nThis is what happens once a user has selected an alternative currency:\n\nWhile the changes - especially the addition of Bitcoin Cash - might rile up some crypto-enthusiasts, the move towards introducing a larger variety of primary currencies does make sense.\n\nIndeed, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, and Litecoin have cemented their positions as one of the most used currencies in the crypto-market.\n\nBack in December last year, leading cryptocurrency exchange desk Coinbase opted to include Bitcoin Cash pairings on its platform.
