"Its value has increased 125,000-fold since 2010 and Julian Assange claims it has helped to bankroll him and Wikileaks. But experts cannot agree whether Bitcoin is the future or a bubble waiting to burst\n\nIT'S 2010 and you walk into your local Post Office, slap \u00a375 on the counter and ask for your money back in dollars.\n\nThe cashier hands you back $121.50 for your hard-earned pounds - $22 more than you would get back for the same transaction today.\n\nOn that same day, if you had instead spent your \u00a375 on a mysterious virtual currency named Bitcoin, you'd now be sitting on a pile of money worth \u00a39.5MILLION.\n\nIndeed, since those early days, the online money has multiplied in value - give or take - 125,000 times over.\n\nSuch is the investment value of Bitcoin, that Julian Assange claims it funded both him and Wikileaks when he was forced to invest in the currency as the result of US sanctions.\n\nAnd financial experts reckon its value could skyrocket even further in the next few years.\n\nSo just how do you invest in the shadowy world of Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin became the world's first entirely virtual currency when it was introduced in January 2009.\n\nUsers cannot carry coins or notes and its value appears only as a number on a screen.\n\nIt was created by a shadowy online account which went by the name Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nNew currency is created via a complex online process called mining which uses supercomputers to create new Bitcoins using complex computer code.\n\nIn its early days, Bitcoin proved relatively worthless - with one notorious example seeing an early pioneer paying for a pizza using two bitcoins.\n\nToday that pizza would be worth the equivalent today of \u00a315,000.\n\nIndeed, within a few years, the currency already had its own 'buried treasure' story.\n\nBrit James Howells famously threw out a computer containing 7,500 Bitcoins on its hard drive - the equivalent of \u00a356MILLION.\n\nAs only the computer the currency was bought on can be used to redeem it, the money was all but lost to Welshman Howells.\n\nThe broken Dell laptop is now believed to be buried below a mound of rubbish at a tip in Newport, Wales.\n\nThe most common way to buy the currency is to download a broker app such as Coinbase and Blockchain.\n\nThese allow users to use a credit or debit cards to exchange pounds for Bitcoin.\n\nUsers do not have to buy whole Bitcoins and can purchase a small percentage that matches the value of their cash investment.\n\nOnce a request has been made, online 'miners' will decide whether to approve the transaction.\n\nIf approved, the money will be taken from a user's account in exchange for Bitcoin.\n\nWhen selling, users can use the same app to sell their Bitcoin in return for its cash value.\n\nBitcoin bought a year ago is now worth ten times what it was in January 2017.\n\nMany commentators believe the craze is a bubble ready to burst.\n\nBut in reality, nobody knows with any great degree of certainty what will happen to the cryptocurrency in the long term.\n\nWall Street commentator Ronnie Moas reckons it should increase by 40 per cent by mid-2018.\n\nBy contrast, economist Kenneth Rogoff predicted \"the price of bitcoin will collapse\" in a piece for the Guardian."
