"Litecoin prices are on pace to post the largest single-day rally since the December record high with the advance breaking above the February opening-range. The rally is now testing near-term downtrend resistance and a breach here would be needed to validate a reversal of the multi-month downtrend.\n\nTechnical Outlook: Litecoin prices broke above the February opening range highs & monthly open resistance today with the rally now testing the upper median-line parallel of the descending pitchfork extending off the record highs. This threshold is backed closely by a Fibonacci confluence at 222/25- a close above this level is needed to validate a breakout of the broader descending formation with such a scenario targeting 260 and the 61.08% retracement at 298.\n\nNew to Forex Trading?

The technical outlook remains constructive while above the monthly open at 162 with a breach above 225 needed to fuel the next leg higher.\n\nWhy does the average trader lose? Avoid these Mistakes in your trading\n\nNear-term bullish invalidation now raised to the yearly low-day close at 130- a break below this level would risk significant losses for Litecoin prices with such a scenario targeting a drop towards confluence support at 116 where the 200-day moving average converges on the 78.6% retracement and basic slope support. Bottom line: prices are testing downtrend resistance and we're looking for a reaction. From a trading standpoint, I'll favor longs while above the monthly open.\n\nFor a complete breakdown of Michael's trading strategy, review his Foundations of Technical Analysis mini-series\n\n- Written by Michael Boutros, Currency Strategist with DailyFX"
