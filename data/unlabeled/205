"The cryptocurrency market continues to grow every day and even for those who follow the ebbs and flows closely, it's not uncommon for a new cryptocurrency to emerge that seems totally foreign to them.\n\nFor those trying to parse the markets and keep track of which cryptocurrency is which, here is a quick guide to some of the most popular and heavily traded cryptocurrencies on the market and the ticker symbol to look for.\n\nHow to identify cryptocurrencies by their ticker symbol.

Despite a massive drop earlier this year that saw it lose more than 50 percent of its value, Bitcoin has rebounded and may be on the rise again.\n\nTicker Symbol: BTC\n\nCurrent Market Cap: $171,492,172,250\n\nBitcoin Price: $10,167\n\nBitcoin Cash\n\nBitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin created in August 2017. When it was launched, Bitcoin Cash promised to increase the size of blocks in its blockchain, allowing for more transactions to be processed -- an issue that has plagued Bitcoin in recent months. Bitcoin Cash has thus far failed to overtake the original Bitcoin.\n\nTicker Symbol: BCH\n\nCurrent Market Cap: $23,563,282,666\n\nBitcoin Cash Price: $1,388\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum is like the hip indie band to Bitcoin's classic rock act. It boasts a range of features like smart contracts that have made it popular among segments of the cryptocurrency community but it's never made it as big as Bitcoin.\n\nTicker Symbol: ETH\n\nCurrent Market Cap: $90,985,142,922\n\nEthereum Price: $931\n\nRipple\n\nRipple's claim to fame is enabling instant and direct transfers between two parties with no fees. The cryptocurrency has been adopted by a number of banks and financial institutions who are experimenting with the network.\n\nTicker Symbol: XRP\n\nCurrent Market Cap: $45,050,573,095\n\nRipple Price: $1.15\n\nTether\n\nTether is arguably the most controversial cryptocurrency. Designed to maintain a \"stable\" price and supposedly tied in value to the U.S. dollar, Tether has many doubters -- including auditors and government regulators -- who believe the cryptocurrency may be fraudulent.\n\nTicker Symbol: USDT\n\nCurrent Market Cap: $2,226,497,148\n\nTether Price: $1.00\n\nLitecoin\n\nLitecoin, founded in 2011, was inspired by Bitcoin but is cheaper and quicker alternative to the popular cryptocurrency. Some believe the functionality and general stability of Litecoin make it a better long-term bet as a cryptocurrency that will survive well past the current boom.\n\nTicker Symbol: LTC\n\nCurrent Market Cap: $12,195,111,480\n\nLitecoin Price: $220.80\n\nStellar\n\nStellar has been a rising star in the cryptocurrency community and experienced massive growth at the end of 2017. Like Ripple, Stellar is focused on improving peer-to-peer transfers by making them frictionless and free.\n\nTicker Symbol: XLM\n\nCurrent Market Cap: $8,407,353,936\n\nStellar Price: $0.45\n\nMonero\n\nMonero has become a popular cryptocurrency because it provides anonymity to its users. That feature has also made it a favorite of criminals and has made Monero one of the most popular currencies in cryptojacking attacks.\n\nTicker Symbol: XMR\n\nCurrent Market Cap: $4,534,272,670\n\nMonero Price: $288\n\nNEO\n\nSometimes called the Chinese Ethereum, NEO boasts a number of features like smart contracts that have investors hopeful for its future.\n\nTicker Symbol: NEO\n\nCurrent Market Cap: $7,988,435,000\n\nNEO Price: $122\n\nIOTA\n\nIOTA is a young cryptocurrency, launched in 2015, designed to be the cryptocurrency for the Internet of Things. It has forgone the standard model of most cryptocurrencies by doing away with mining and traditional blockchain networks.\n\nTicker Symbol: MIOTA\n\nCurrent Market Cap: $5,909,503,744\n\nIOTA Price: $2.13\n\nDash\n\nThe goal of Dash is to be like liquid cash that can be quickly transferred and used anywhere in the world.\n\nTicker Symbol: DASH\n\nCurrent Market Cap: $5,531,822,525\n\nDash Price: $701\n\nNEM\n\nNEM is another relatively young cryptocurrency, but one that has already gained adoption by financial institutions in Japan. Unfortunately, it's also been in the headlines thanks to a massive hack at a popular cryptocurrency exchange that resulted in $530 million worth of NEM being stolen .\n\nTicker Symbol: XEM\n\nCurrent Market Cap: $5,005,808,999\n\nNEM Price: $0.55"
