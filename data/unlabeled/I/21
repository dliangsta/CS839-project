"Venezuela has developed a brand new cryptocurrency, called petro.\n\nThe government of the crisis-hit country says it was created in order to help overcome financial sanctions imposed by the US and the EU.\n\nHowever, petro is considered to be illegal by opposition leaders in Venezuela, and there are also concerns that anyone who buys into it could quickly lose their investment.\n\nGadgets and tech news in pictures + show all Gadgets and tech news in pictures 1/43\n\nDesigned by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

However, many people consider bitcoin to be more of an asset than a currency, because it can be much harder to spend than traditional money.\n\n\"The most important contribution of petro to the cryptoassets' market and the new digital economy will be the support offered by a sovereign state,\" reads the website for petro.\n\n\"The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela guarantees that it will receive petro as a form of payment for national taxes, fees, contributions and public services, taking as a reference the previous day's Venezuelan oil basket price with a discount. This will ensure that the buyer always has a return value adjusted to the value of his investment.\n\nHowever, Venezuela's opposition-led parliament considers petro's IPO to be \"a forward sale of Venezuelan oil,\" and \"tailor-made for corruption\".\n\nThere are also fears that the creation of petro is little more than a desperate bid to raise money, and that it will quickly lose much of its value, leaving investors out of pocket.\n\nRead more Venezuela halts air and sea traffic with three neighbouring countries\n\nThat fear is what led to China banning ICOs last year, in order to stop people from falling prey to financial scams, at a time when mainstream interest in digital currencies was skyrocketing.\n\n\"During the last 4 years Venezuela has experienced the biggest financial crisis in its history, a situation that has resulted in a devaluation of its national currency, the bolivar,\" the petro website says.\n\n\"The petro will be the foundation of a policy to promote development, infrastructure and training of young people in electronic mining, coding, cryptography, network security and economics 4.0, that will enable the exploitation of Venezuela and other developing countries' most valuable assets in a new world of transparent, deconcentrated and manipulation-free markets, all thanks to technology.\"\n\nThe Independent's bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.
