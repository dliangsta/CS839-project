The entity type that we have marked up in the documents is **Cryptocurrency**.

The markups can be found as follows: 

Everyline in a document is followed by a markup line; the markup line consists of the same number of words as the original line. If the first character of a word in the markup line is a 1, then it means that the corresponding word in the original line is a cryptocurrency that we marked up. Else, it starts with a \`

**For example:**

New York: Bitcoin hit a three-week high on Tuesday

\`__ \`____ 1______ \`__ \` \`_________ \`___ \`_ \`______

The first line is the original line and the second is the markup line. The third word in the original line is a cryptocurrency. Therefore, the third word in the markup line starts with a 1.
