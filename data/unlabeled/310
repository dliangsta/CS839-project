"Meanwhile, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices rallied on Thursday\n\nThe truth may be out there, but, the efforts of real life Fox Mulders are apparently being thwarted by Bitcoin rather than some shadowy conspiracy.\n\nRocketing demand for high-powered computer hardware is the problem. Star gazers seeking far away alien life are unable to get hold of necessary processing power due to cryptocurrency 'miners' buying up graphics processing units (GPUs) and other high performance microchips.\n\nFor the uninitiated, an increasingly large network of cryptocurrency computers currently perform algorithmic tasks central to the blockchain systems that operate the infrastructure beneath digital currencies such as Bitcoin.\n\nThe owners of the machines, known as 'miners', earn digital currency units every time they successfully complete the computational task.\n\nAs the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have soared, the practise has developed something of an arms race. Processing power is the competitive battleground for miners - the fastest processors allow more lucrative coins to be secured.\n\nSoaring demand for the best equipment has caused a scarcity of processors for other demanding scientific pursuits, like stargazing.\n\nSpecifically, researchers for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) organisation want to expand their capabilities, but, they can't get hold of the right equipment.\n\n\"We'd like to use the latest GPUs ... and we can't get 'em,\" SETI chief scientist Dr Dan Werthimer is quoted in a report.\n\nHe added: \"This is a new problem, it's only happened on orders we've been trying to make in the last couple of months.\"\n\nBitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin all advance\n\nIn the cryptocurrency market, the price of Bitcoin is continuing its recovery. Bitcoin was up US$409 or 4.3% in Thursday's dealing, changing hands at US$9,887.\n\nThe Ethereum price, meanwhile, rose 3% to trade at US$951. And the Ripple XRP token advanced 9.5% at US$1.16.\n\nElsewhere, attentions have been on Litecoin - which was the fifth largest digital currency - where changes and upgrades promise to bring it into the mainstream. The Litecoin price jumped 27% changing hands at US$232.\n\nLitepay, a new payment system for Litecoin, will allow businesses to accept Litecoin payments, while it will also offer users the ability to \"spend dollars anywhere debit cards are accepted, or withdraw cash from any compatible ATM\". It is due to be rolled out at the end of this month.\n\nShare Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version Jamie Ashcroft\n\nRegister here to be notified of future BLOCK Company articles"
