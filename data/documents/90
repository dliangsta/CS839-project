"Forget traditional bank robberies, that's like the wild west... especially now that we have cryptocurrency exchanges that can be hacked and a huge $170 million can be stolen at today's lowered values.\n\nThis is what has happened to Italian cryptocurrency exchange BitGrail, with the company announcing on its website that it has lost $170 million to fraudulent transactions, and that they've approached authorities over the matter. BitGrail has since suspended all withdrawals and deposits \"in order to conduct further verifications\".\n\nBitGrail has said that it won't be refunding 100% of what users' lost, with BitGrail founder Francesco \"The Bomber\" Firano saying that there's no 100% way to refund users. Firano took to Twitter, where he tweeted: \"Unfortunately there is no way to give it back to you at 100% (we only got 4 MLN XRN right now)\".\n\nRussian scientists busted mining crypto in NUCLEAR facility\n\n6 x GPU packs now on sale for miners, GTX 1060s or GTX 1080s\n\nNVIDIA says cryptocurrency demand 'exceeded expectations'\n\nLedger owner?
