J.P. Morgan has called cryptocurrencies the "innovative maelstrom" around Blockchain and said they are "unlikely to disappear" in what appears to be an internal report from the company, published Feb. 8, 2018..

After the rapper 50Cent made millions from bitcoins, another celebrity has now showed her fascination for the spark of bitcoins, that too quite overtly. The comedian and the talk show host Ellen DeGeneres spoke about bitcoins on her show recently. She says, "One thing I am down with right now, that I think everybody is learning about, is bitcoin. Who's heard of bitcoin? Who can explain what bitcoin is? Liar. Nobody knows how it works. Nobody.".

She further says, "Everybody is talking about bitcoin; nobody understands it. It's like a plot twist in a confusing movie. When you're watching a movie and your friends act like they know what's going on, and you're like, 'Yeah, I do too!' And then you're like, 'What the hell is every ... I have no idea!' All I know is that bitcoin is either worth twenty thousand dollars or nothing; that's what I know..

"The huge volatility of the price of cryptocurrencies - with respect to either traditional currencies or to a basket of goods and services - has made use of cryptocurrencies as a unit of account impractical," it said.

"Economists have long viewed successful (i.e. relatively price-stable) currencies as natural monopolies in a given geographic area.

It's still a few days before that February 20th release. But you can get a headstart by finding a clue in the game website's source code, according to the site's FAQ. To pull up the site's source code, just right-click anywhere on the site and click "View page source." It'll look like a lot of nonsense to anybody who's not familiar with HTML code:.

It's not clear where the clue is hidden: It could be in the source code of either the Home page or FAQ page. The other two clickable links lead you to a press kit download and the Steam product page, so there's no source code to browse through there..

The cryptocurrency market recovery finally began to stall on Friday, potentially bringing an end to the longest rally of 2018. The Bitcoin Cash price, however, continued to post double-digit percentage gains even as other coins began to trade sideways..

Yesterday, the cryptocurrency market cap had reached a pinnacle of $486.5 billion, its highest point since Feb. 1. Unfortunately, the market entered Friday on a downward slope, and the cryptocurrency market cap has since declined to a present value of $471.9 billion..

The Bitcoin price rode a bullish wave this week, rising as high as $10,300 after trading below $8,000 as recently as Feb. 11. On Friday, though, the Bitcoin price dipped back below $10,000. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin was valued at $9,793 on Bitfinex, which translates into a $166.9 billion market cap and represents a slight increase over its previous-day level..

The Bitcoin Cash price leaped by 12 percent for the day, reaching as high as 1,550 on Bitfinex before ebbing back to $1,457 at the time of writing. Bitcoin Cash was the only top-tier coin to post a double-digit percentage advance -- indeed, it was the only coin in the top 10 to rise by more than two percent -- and it now boasts a market cap of $25.5 billion..

The North American Crypto Currency Conference, or NAC3 for short, will be expanded in 2018 following the success of last year's event in Las Vegas. Two events are planned: one in New York on Feb. 24 and 25 at the Sheraton in Times Square, and another in Los Angeles a month later, on March 24 and 25, at Playa Studios. Described by organizer and founder Andy Crane as the only bitcoin and blockchain conference designed for "the average person," NAC3 offers access to its roster of keynote speakers in a highly inclusive event that welcomes all ages and experience levels. "NAC3 is designed for the average person in every way," Crane said in a statement. "Whether you're a total beginner or a seasoned pro, you'll walk away from NAC3 with a great deal of useful and actionable information." NAC3 will also feature an intensive, all-day advanced trading course taught by Crypto Bud (Ivan Leon), as well as keynote presentations by Day Hay (Crypto Riot), Rob Paone (Crypto Bobby), and Nathan Leung (Cryptonauts), as well as blockchain legal expert Jason Civalleri and Polyswarm CEO Steve Bassi. Event sponsors include Polyswarm, Blockmason, Blockpass, CEX.io, and Bitcoin.com. Tickets for the New York and L.A. events are available at https://www.nac3.io. Ticket giveaway NAC3 announced it will give away more than $10,000 worth of free tickets to the New York and Los Angeles NAC3 events to ensure that everyone who wants to attend can through a special "scholarship program." "The goal is to make sure that the tickets go to students of cryptocurrency who would otherwise not be able to attend due to the ticket price, which is $247 for admission," the organizers said in a statement. Those interested in winning the NAC3 scholarship can apply at http://www.davidhay.org/nac3-scholarship-program..

Kevin Abosch, the photographer who purportedly sold a photo of a potato for over $1,000,000 in 2016, has now become the photographer behind the world's most expensive crypto-artwork by selling a photo of a rose on the blockchain for $1,000,000..

CNN reports that the photo, titled Forever Rose, was purchased yesterday on Valentines Day by a group of 10 collectors that included investment funds, an advisory firm, crypto projects, and a leading China-based crypto investor. There were over 150 interested buyers, and the 10 collectors who ended up purchasing the photo split the price (paid in GTO and IAMA tokens) evenly 10 ways. The $1 million is believed to be the highest price ever paid for a cryptocurrency artwork..

Prices had tumbled amid fears of global cryptocurrency crackdown by governments, but got a lift following signs that the U.S. had no plans to ban cryptocurrency earlier this month. Investors took heart, in particular, from remarks before the Senate by Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Christopher Giancarlo and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Jay Clayton. Their general message, which came as Bitcoin was bottoming, was: The U.S. doesn't want to quash the market but regulate it..

Layering on the positive sentiment was South Korea. The country helped lower Bitcoin prices this year after imposing stricter regulations and even floating an outright ban on cryptocurrency exchanges. But now it is apparently considering a licensing system for cryptocurrency exchanges, according to reports from Business Korea..

The company behind iconic video games such as Pac-Man and Pong is planning to launch its own cryptocurrency, dubbed "Atari Token," according to an announcement last week..
`__ `______ `_____ `_____ `____ `____ `___ `_ `______ `__ `___ `_ `_______ `_ `_____ `__ `__ `______________ `_____ `_____ `______ `________ `_ `_ `___________ `___ `_____ 
As part of the effort, Atari acquired a 15% stake in a Gibraltar-based company, Infinity Networks, Ltd and has licensed its brand to the firm. The partnership - which was previously hinted at in a December statement - will see the development of a digital entertainment platform underpinned by the so-called Atari Token. The game maker noted that its investment was "made without cash disbursement by Atari.".

"Our aim is to take strategic positions with a limited cash risk, in order to best create value with the assets and the Atari brand," Atari chairman and CEO Frederic Chesnais said in a statement..

The name selection is a notable one, given that Atari had previously created an Atari Token to serve as a currency for making in-game purchases. Whether the newly-announced Atari Token will serve that purpose remains to be seen..

Additionally, Atari said that it plans to integrate cryptocurrencies via its branding partnership with Pariplay, Ltd, which offers online games using Atari games and characters as part of their design. Last week's statement also notably hints at the creation of a second token, which would be used in conjunction with the online casino plan..

"To broaden the appeal of these new casinos, and once the Atari Token available, Atari has the project to launch Pong Token, a second token dedicated to crypto-casinos and usable on these gaming sites. The details of this launch of crypto-casinos will be announced soon," the statement (loosely translated) reads..

As might be expected, the announcement has drawn comparisons - and not entirely favorable - to Kodak, the one-time photo giant that has licensed out its brand for the creation of a KodakCoin. The project was announced in January, with plans to hold an initial coin offering at the end of that month. That token sale was later delayed, and no launch date has since been released..

The Litecoin Cash Controversy.
`__ `_______ `___ `___________ 
Litecoin's seemingly magical run is a bit questionable for analysts due to some controversy surrounding the news for the supposed upcoming fork, "Litecoin Cash (LCC)." According to the LCC official website, existing LTC holders at block 1,371,111 will receive 10 LCC tokens for every 1 LTC. This news may have had an influence in Litecoin's current bull run..

However, Litecoin founder and creator Charlie Lee, together with the Litecoin community, have called this project a scam, dismissing the news as mere propaganda to confuse Litecoin investors. The people behind the LCC project may have gotten their inspiration from a similar fork event that happened with Bitcoin last year..

The Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork.
`__ `______ `___ `___ `____ 
On August 1, 2017, the Bitcoin scalability debate resulted to a hard fork in Bitcoin, creating a new blockchain. The new cryptocurrency was called Bitcoin Cash. The hard fork propelled the price of Bitcoin from the $2700 level to the $3400 level by the end of the first week of August. Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, grew from $278 to $354 during the same period, with a spike in price on August 2 reaching $727..

Disregarding the LCC news, Litecoin seems to be performing well, having a short-term momentum in favor of the bulls. Breaking the $250 psychological barrier would signal a strong bull run towards the $300 level. Closing below the February 11 low of $142 would be the only invalidation for the bullish pattern. Some influential players in the cryptomarket believe that Litecoin may hit the $1000 mark by 2018 if all goes well with the market. In general, many investors are still confident of Litecoin's technological potential..

The price of a single bitcoin hit $10,000 for the first time since the beginning of the month, underscoring a rally in the world's No. 1 cryptocurrency since touching a recent low. Bitcoin has risen about 68% since touching a low below $6,000, according to news and research site CoinDesk. Bitcoin BTCUSD, +9.77% hit an intraday high of $10,064.98, representing a 5.6% increase on the day, dragging other major digital currencies along for the uptrend. That said, the virtual currency is still below its late-December peak at around $20,000..

Round prices seem to continue to command the minds of traders in the Bitcoin universe, especially when it comes to the most popular of cryptocurrencies. Just as it happened when the price of Bitcoin VS USD nearly met 20k, now here once again, there's a bit of a hurdle. After Bitcoin went over 19K USD, it tumbled down to $6k. Now not long after that trip, the price is rumbling back up over $9k..

It's almost as if there's some real liquidity in the price of Bitcoin, isn't there? It would seem as though the massive interest in the cryptocurrency market as a whole lead to some sort of price jockeying over the past few months. It's not as if there've been any big mentions of Bitcoin and the crypto market in general, is it? Oh yes, yes it is..

Now as the market reached up to 10k overnight, resistance can be found in the price of bitcoins. This week the Death Cross took place - EMA (150, close) rose above EMA (20, close) as the chart below shows. This chart comes from crypto trader Wilson Trodler, showing how this bit of a jump back up doesn't necessarily mean the market's suddenly saved. In fact it's a bit more of a mess than that..

Unfortunate for all traders, those that believe in the round number points are those that make or break the market. Everyone else - the folks that know the difference between 9,999 and 10,001 is extremely tiny - were forced to follow, and they'll continue to be forced to follow. Watching the emotional reactions of investors and acting before they make their FOMO or FUD moves - therein lies the true profit making playbook..

Ripple is being traded as a cryptocurrency, but it is more of a token than digital money. It peaked at $3.31 in January, but is trading at around $1.15 this week. The idea of the token is to act as a bridge between international bank transactions, not to become an alternative for fiat currencies. The majority of ripple tokens are held by the parent company, meaning that it can regulate their price..

The goal of the new currency is to increase the "block speed" at which the network can process transactions. The foundation says litecoin cash has a goal block time of 2.5 minutes - faster than litecoin. Like bitcoin and most other major cryptocurrencies, but unlike the existing Litecoin network, litecoin cash will use the more energy intensive, but potentially more secure, proof-of-work mining method..

Litecoin, which was designed to be less energy intensive than bitcoin, saw an astronomical rise in 2017. The cryptocurrency skyrocketed from just $3.73 a year ago, to as high as $365 in December, leading founder Charlie Lee to warn investors about the possibility of losing everything. He also sold his entire stake after being accused of price manipulation..

LONDON: The number of hedge funds focused on trading cryptocurrencies more than doubled in the four months to Feb. 15, despite sharp falls in the value of the virtual coins in recent weeks, data from fintech research house Autonomous NEXT showed on Thursday..

The firm recorded a record high of 226 global hedge funds with such a strategy, up from 110 global hedge funds as of Oct. 18. That itself was up from 55 funds at Aug. 29 and just 37 at the start of 2017..

The surge in funds comes at a volatile time for the cryptocurrencies they trade in. After hitting a record high close to $20,000 in December, bitcoin lost 70 percent of its value to slip below $6,000 in January, posting its worst monthly performance in three years..

Rival cryptocurrencies have also seen sharp declines. The so-called "market cap" of all virtual currencies - their price multiplied by the number of coins issued - currently stands at around $465 billion, according to trade website Coinmarketcap, down from more than $830 billion in early January..

The popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin was trading at $9,610.39 in India today on CoinDesks's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) at the time of reporting. Bitcoin climbed nearly 10 percent, the highest level reached since February 4. Bitcoin crossed the psychologically key $9,000 level amid improved sentiment about government regulation in the US. Bitcoin touched the highs of $8,897.81 yesterday. The popular cryptocurrency that was most purchased cryptocurrency in the second half of the last year is still long way from reaching the high of $19,783 that it touched on December 17 last year. Still, Bitcoin is trading for the year so far. However, not all are optimistic on Bitcoin recovering its highs of the last year considering the trading regulations that various countries are mulling over putting on the cryptocurrency..

Bitcoin is mother of all bubbles and this bubble will burst anytime soon, said Nouriel Roubini some weeks back. The famous economist who had rightly predicted the US housing crash in 2008 has once against said that the digital currency is on its way down as it lacks any fundamental value. The case of Bitcoin will turn out to similar to Mississippi bubble, tech bubble, and Tulip mania. The Bitcoin received a shot in the arm lately when popular business magazine Forbes came out with a list of Bitocin millionaires. The list was first of its kind brought out by a reputed media organisation. In India too, good amount of investments are parked in the virtual currencies especially Bitcoin..

In the last two months, Bitcoin struggled amid various fears over its regulation especially by South Korean regulators. Back in India even, government, RBI, Sebi and income tax department has issued warnings to the investors parking their money in the digital currencies especially Bitcoin. In Budget 2018, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said that cryptocurrency is not a legal tender in India but the government will explore blockchain to usher in the digital economy..

Bitcoin is up 3.6% against the dollar to $US9,825.91 at 7.55 a.m. GMT (2.55 a.m. ET). As the chart at the top shows, bitcoin slumped at the start of February but has been picking up again over the last week or so. It still remains far off its all-time highs of over $US19,000 reached just before Christmas..

Right now we're in one of the worst positions ever for consumer graphics cards, with prices sky high and stocks at rock bottom, most GPUs are being eaten up by crypto miners. What can help, other than a purported next-gen GeForce GTX 20 series and possibly mining-specific SKUs of GTX 20 series cards? Ethereum ASIC miners, that's what..

The latest news coming in from China is that mining giant Bitmain is working on an Ethereum ASIC miner, the purported Antminer F3. Bitmain's rumored F3 Ethereum miner would pack 3 motherboards with 6 ASICs per motherboard, as well as 32 x 1GB DDR3 memory chips that would make for a very power efficient, but incredibly powerful Ethereum ASIC miner. This would put GPU mining for Ethereum out of business, almost overnight..

Looking for ET isn't easy. But unfortunately for the folks at SETI and elsewhere, it's gotten a lot harder in recent months, thanks to a rush on computing power spurred by cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and, to a lesser extent, Bitcoin..

The root of the problem is an acute shortage of computer graphics cards, known as GPUs. Top-of-the-line consumer GPUs are prized by both cryptocurrency miners and astronomers for their ability to crunch large batches of big numbers at a low price. But as prices for cryptocurrencies have risen, miners have snapped up the cards, driving up prices on secondary markets like eBay..

Graphics chip manufacturers have been struggling to meet demand for their wares, and they're wary of ramping up production too quickly. While Ethereum can still be profitably mined using consumer hardware, Bitcoin miners have moved on to specialized equipment. If Ethereum miners do the same -- or if the cryptocurrency's value plummets -- it's possible that the GPU crunch will ease. But if not, astronomers may have to get creative..

Of the first 250,000 tax filings, less than 100 people reported owning any cryptocurrency, according to a survey from credit-monitoring company, Credit Karma. If that sounds tiny, it translates to a minuscule 0.04% of cryptotraders paying taxes to Uncle Sam, according to the company..

KuCoin has a great reputation as a secure and technologically advanced exchange and should bring significant new market exposure to Electroneum. The Electroneum team will be working with KuCoin to promote the mobile-focused cryptocurrency across Asia using KuCoin's "To The Moon" marketing package, which is focused on introducing new users to trade Electroneum..

We support 20 different languages but are only currently listed on English based exchanges. We've chosen the KuCoin marketing campaign package that has had the most dramatic effect on the price of other coins that have listed on KuCoin.

A group of 13 experts have suggested Bitcoin will be the best performing of all cryptocurrencies this year and could shoot up to a value of $14,928 by March 1 and hit $43,472 by the year's end - more than four times the $9,200 it's currently worth..

The fear and build up towards Aug. 1, 2017, and the creation of Bitcoin Cash which forked off the original chain was monumental. However, it was a damp squib for the future of Bitcoin as it actually spiked in value..

Since then, forks on Bitcoin have become almost as common as ICOs, and in fact, forks on the Bitcoin chain look to be the latest trend for 2018 as new companies look to cash in on the familiar Bitcoin name..

Bitcoin Cash is, of course, the most well known Bitcoin fork out there, sitting comfortably in the top five coins in terms of market cap. However, in 2017, there were 19 registered Bitcoin forks. Still, that pales in comparison to the 50 that are expected this year, according to Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research..

That number could still rise further as there is even services out there that are providing rudimentary programming skills to launch a clone. This will of course have a big effect in the cryptocurrency market as hedge fund manager Ari Paul predicted in a tweet:.

There are a number of reasons to fork off the Bitcoin Blockchain, some do it, in the case of Bitcoin Cash, to seemingly improve facets of the old coin, while others may have different motives. As George Kimionis, chief executive officer of Coinomi puts it:.
`____ `__ ` `_____ `_ `______ `_ `___ `__ `__ `______ `__________ `___ `_ `__ `_ `__ `___ `_ `______ `____ `_ `________ `______ `_____ `_ `__ `__ `____ `____ `_____ `__ `___ `________ `_______ `_ `_____ `________ `____ `________ `______ `_ `______ `___ `___ 
"Unfortunately, most fork-based projects we see today are more of a sheer money grab. Looking back a few years from now we might realize that they were just mutations fostered by investors blinded by numerical price increases rather than honest attempts to contribute to the Blockchain ecosystem.".

Kimionis also sees a new phase in the ICO marketplace with the original hype simmered down somewhat. Forking adds a little edge to a new coin. And Rhett Creighton, who's working on the upcoming Bitcoin Private fork, predicts:.
`_______ `___ `___ ` `__ `____ `_ `__ `__ `__________ `___ `__ `_______ `___ `_______ `___ `________ `______ `___ ` `_____ `___ `_ ` `__ `____ `__ `____ `_________ `____ `______ `_ `__ `_______ `______ `______ `____ `_________ 
"Bitcoin forks are kind of the new altcoin. We are going to see now a bunch of Bitcoin forks. And they are going to start replacing some of the top hundred altcoins.".
`_______ `____ `__ `___ `_ `__ `__ `_______ `_ `__ `____ `_ `__ `__ ` `____ `_ `______ `_____ `__ `___ `__ `____ `_ `____ `________ `___ `_ `__ `__ `______ `__________ 
It is hard to see these minor forks, even the likes of Bitcoin Gold and Diamond which reached the news, really, truly, adding much to the Blockchain environment. Even Bitcoin Cash has been linked to a money making scheme for the likes of Jihan Wu and Roger Ver. The difference between trying to improve the Blockchain, and to make money off a name, is a very blurred line..

Litecoin is currently priced at $197 on Bitfinex, although premiums on other exchanges have hoisted its global average just above the $200 mark. Litecoin now has an $11.1 billion market cap, lifting it to fifth in the rankings..

Diverging from previous pumps, LTC trading volume is very evenly distributed across the world's major exchanges. At 26 percent, OKEx accounts for the largest slice, while GDAX ranks second with 14 percent. South Korea-based Bithumb and Upbit each prices Litecoin at an eight percent premium over other exchanges, but their trading pairs only account for a combined 10 percent of global LTC volume..

Tuesday's rally comes in direct response to the announcement that LitePay, a payment processing company modeled after industry stalwart BitPay, is scheduled to launch on Feb. 26. The company quietly made the announcement on Twitter on Monday, but word seems to have traveled slowly, given that the rally is just now taking off..

According to the San Francisco-based company's website, LitePay will offer many of the same features as BitPay. Most notably, it will provide businesses with the ability to accept LTC payments that are settled in fiat currency. Additionally, it will issue Litecoin debit cards, which users can fund with LTC and use at virtually any retailer..

Since Litecoin markets itself as a payment-focused cryptocurrency, the establishment of LitePay's infrastructure will greatly aid its utility for this use case..

However, another theory is that Litecoin's bullish pivot could be tied to the announcement that a group of developers is going to fork the main Litecoin blockchain on Feb. 19 to create Litecoin Cash, airdropping coins to all wallet addresses that hold LTC at the time of the fork..

Bitcoin mining is becoming more expensive, according to JPMorgan..
`______ `_____ `_ `_______ `___ `_________ `________ `_ `_________ 
Bitcoin miners are in an arms race and it is driving the cost of minting new bitcoin to all-time highs..
`______ `_____ `__ `_ `_ `___ `___ `__ `_ `_ `______ `__ `___ `_ `______ `__ `______ `_ `_______ `______ 
That's according to a big report on cryptocurrency out Friday by financial giant JPMorgan..
`_____ `________ `_ ` `__ `_____ `_ `_____________ `__ `_____ `_ `________ `____ `_________ 
Miners are the folks who unleash new bitcoin into the universe by running computationally intensive algorithms on systems called rigs. The miners pumping out the most computing power - or "hash rate," referring to how many cryptographic calculations the machines can do per second - have the best chance of earning a new bitcoin. As such, miners are building more and more rigs to one-up their competition..
`_____ `__ `__ `____ `__ `______ `__ `______ `___ `__ `_______ `_ `______ `______________ `________ `_________ `_ `______ `_____ `____ `__ `_____ `______ `__ `__ `___ `________ `____ ` `_ `____ `_____ `________ `_ `__ `___ `____________ `___________ `__ `_______ `__ `_ `__ `_____ ` `___ `__ `___ `_____ `_ `______ ` `__ `_______ `_ `____ `_____ `__ `_______ `___ `__ `___ `___ `_ `_____ `____ `____________ 
"The industry is currently in a hash rate arms race, as the current bitcoin price is incentivizing the addition of more and more mining capacity," the report said..
`___ `_______ `_ `________ `_ ` `___ `___ `___ `____ `_ `__ `______ `______ `____ `_ `____________ `__ `_______ `_ `___ `__ `___ `_____ `_________ `__ `_____ `_____ 
That doesn't mean more bitcoin are being created. The coin's network is designed to increase the difficulty of successfully mining a coin as the total hash power increases in order to maintain a more or less steady rate of bitcoin creation. More hash power means higher energy costs. As such, the cost to mine one bitcoin has increased dramatically..

Dealing in Bitcoins? We advise caution as it was in bear territory last week, plummeting all the way to $6,000. It stabilised over the weekend at over $8,000, and investors heaved a huge sigh of relief. For how long, we can't tell, because we don't know, but beware of scams and get-quick-rich schemes. Conmen are using the temporary rise and fall in the value of the cryptocurrency to swindle people of their hard-earned money..

A Sharjah resident has lost Dh2million in such a scheme, according to our report, and readers should watch out for such fraudsters who are using the volatility in the price of the digital currency to profit from it in an illegal way. Leading economist Nouriel Roubini has even predicted that Bitcoin could crash to zero. The American economist last week called it the 'biggest bubble in human history'..

Roubini based his predictions on what is known as "wash trading" that traders use to inflate prices. It involves "buying and selling" digital orders to tamper with crypto-markets. Reports say this is already happening with regard to Bitcoin, so it's best to go slow until more clarity emerges..

So, what's really happening in the crypto world, a space fraught with risks, where only those who dare stand to benefit? The market is recovering after last week's blues. On Monday, other digital currencies like Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple were up from between 4 to 10 per cent. Bitcoin flirted with $9,000 before falling. We agree it may be teasing and tantalising even at that rate, if you are prone to flirting with danger, or if you have the money to burn. But it would be wise to lend a ear to what Roubini is saying. A bubble may be in the making without proper control..

Meanwhile, the regulator of Abu Dhabi's international financial centre said it is considering rules for virtual currency exchanges. This is a shift, which bodes well to prevent future volatility and protect investors. Currently, the UAE Central Bank does not recognise Bitcoin as there are fears that it could be used for money laundering and terror financing. A change in policy helps the government keep an eye on digital markets and would be in the best interest of residents..

Already slashed by more than half since hitting a record near US$20,000 (RM79,000) in December, the cryptocurrency could plunge a further 90 per cent in an environment of unsustainably growing supply, according to Bloomberg Intelligence commodity strategist Mike McGlone. Using Amazon.com Inc and the Nasdaq Composite Index's spectacular rise and retreat at the turn of the millennium as a proxy, he said the currency could plunge to US$900..

While the creators of Bitcoin intended to limit supply to 21 million coins, forks mean that there are already more than 50 million outstanding coins based on the original blockchain. There's also nothing preventing rivals from spawning an infinite amount of clones, he said. The number of tradable cryptocurrencies jumped 120 per cent in the past year..

Iceland is experiencing a boom in bitcoin mining a boom for the economy but also a huge drain on power resources in the country. Snorri Sigurbergsson, an employee of the energy company HS Orka, claims the consumption of energy by cryptocurrency miners is likely to double to 100 megawatts this year. This is greater than Icelandic households use according to the national energy authority. There are 340,000 people in Iceland. Bitcoin mining Bitcoin mining is explained in the appended video. The Investopedia explains: Bitcoin mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger, known as the block chain, and also the means through which new bitcoin are released. Anyone with access to the internet and suitable hardware can participate in mining. The mining process involves compiling recent transactions into blocks and trying to solve a computationally difficult puzzle. The participant who first solves the puzzle gets to place the next block on the block chain and claim the rewards. The rewards, which incentivize mining, are both the transaction fees associated with the transactions compiled in the block as well as newly released bitcoin. Every ten minutes a miner wins a price of 12.5 bitcoins, still worth over a hundred thousand dollars in spite of a huge decline of more than half of bitcoin's value. Mining has now consumed power to the extent that the entire network consumption is said to be equivalent to that of the Republic of Ireland. In Iceland power consumption by mining has overtaken its other productive uses. The reason is simple. Iceland has a great deal of energy with geothermal and electric plants around the island that is has many volcanoes. Miners look worldwide for cheap and plentiful sources of power. The arctic air cools the server rooms instead of expensive air-conditioning as the chips used to mine produce huge amounts of heat. For now mining facilities are increasing power consumption fast in Iceland Sigurbergsson said that for now there is exponential growth in energy consumption by mining centers. He does not see this stopping at present. He claims that he is getting many calls from investors wanting to build centers in Iceland. However, there are doubters as to the value to Iceland of the increased mining activity. Smari McCarthy an MP from the Pirate Party said: "Cryptocurrency mining requires almost no staff, very little in capital investments, and mostly leaves no taxes either. The value to Iceland... is virtually zero.".

Bitcoin and all things cryptocurrency have found themselves at the top of a list of most highly demanded skills for freelancers in 2018. Leading freelance marketplace, Upwork, recently surveyed their users and found that skills relating to digital currency were the fastest-growing sector of freelancer talents on their platform. The results were also dominated by emerging technologies. Along with Bitcoin, AI and AR related skills were noted as growing rapidly. Evidently, the appetite for those with skills relating to cryptocurrency is not following suit with the price of a single Bitcoin which recently took a tumble from its all-time highs..

This figure is based on the findings from the survey by Upwork and the Freelancers Union entitled "Freelancing in America"..

Jesse Powell, the founder and CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange, Kraken, has stated that the entire cryptocurrency market will reach a $1 trillion valuation this year.

One of the adverse effects of bitcoin has been the resources it requires to be mined. Mining warehouses, and hobbyists, have been looking to get in on the mining in a bid to strike lucky and earn some bitcoins if they mine certain blocks. The thirst for additional computing power has caused a surge in the price of graphics card; Nvidia reported a strong fourth quarter in 2017 as a result..

Thus tweeted Barry Silbert, founder of the Digital Currency Group (DCG), on Monday. The DCG, of course, is the parent company of Grayscale Investments, which has created a fund that holds ETC on behalf of fund shareholders..

Consequently, Silbert has a vested interest in promoting ETC. Even so, Silbert's tweet was prescient, because within hours the Ethereum Classic price had embarked on a 20 percent rally -- an advance that came even as other top cryptocurrencies pivoted into negative territory..

It's not immediately clear what is contributing to the rally. There is speculation that it is tied to the upcoming launch of the Callisto Network, which will airdrop its tokens (CLO) to current ETC holders. However, developers have planned the airdrop's blockchain snapshot for block 5500000, which will take place on approximately March 5. Consequently, it seems somewhat doubtful that ETC is surging to such a great degree when the airdrop is still 20 days out..

A glance at ETC's daily trading volume, though, shows a fairly-significant concentration of volume on South Korean exchanges, which currently price it at a premium of roughly seven percent over its value on other exchanges. On Upbit, ETC/KRW is priced at an equivalent value of $34.17, while Coinone prices it as high as $34.27. Altogether, KRW pairs account for more than 37 percent of all ETC trading volume..

That said, this concentration of trading volume does not necessarily indicate that this is a coordinated pump. Rather, it could be indicative of the fact that South Korean traders -- forced to undergo KYC verification following the adoption of new cryptocurrency trading regulations -- had yet to buy into ETC following the initial Callisto announcement last month..

Litecoin holders will receive 10 tokens of litecoin cash for every one litecoin they own, the newly minted Litecoin Cash foundation said Monday..
`_______ `______ `___ `______ `_ `_____ `_ `_______ `___ `__ `____ `__ `_______ `___ `___ `__ `____ `_____ `_______ `___ `_________ `___ `_______ 
The goal of the new currency is to increase the "block speed" at which the network can process transactions. The foundation says litecoin cash has a goal block time of 2.5 minutes - faster than litecoin. Like bitcoin and most other major cryptocurrencies, but unlike the existing Litecoin network, litecoin cash will use the more energy intensive, but potentially more secure, proof-of-work mining method..

The fork will occur precisely at block 1371111. The Litecoin network is currently on block 1368028 at the time of writing,according to BlockCypher. The fork is expected to occur sometime around 9 p.m. ET on Monday, February 19..

Litecoin, which was designed to be less energy intensive than bitcoin, saw an astronomical rise in 2017. The cryptocurrency skyrocketed from just $US3.73 a year ago, to as high as $US365 in December, leading founder Charlie Lee to warn investors about the possibility of losing everything. He also sold his entire stake after being accused of price manipulation..

Forks aren't uncommon in the cryptocurrency world, although they are not without controversy. Bitcoin cash famously split from the flagship bitcoin in August 2017, but the forked cryptocurrency has been accused of merely riding the coattails of the more established bitcoin..

The price of ETC, the native currency of the ethereum classic blockchain, is reporting double-digit gains Tuesday, a move that effectively recovers losses seen over the last two weeks..
`__ `____ `_ `___ `__ `_____ `_______ `_ `__ `_______ `______ `__________ `_ `________ `___________ `____ `_______ ` `___ `___ `__________ `_______ `_____ `___ `___ `__ `___ `__ `______ 
As of writing, ETC is changing hands at $31.70 on Bitfinex, having clocked a two-week high of $32.90 earlier in the day's trading session. The cryptocurrency has appreciated by 20 percent in the last 24 hours, as per data source CoinMarketCap..

Stepping back, the move effectively means ETC has come full circle, returning back to a level last seen at January's end. The broad-based sell-off in the crypto markets that began on Jan. 30 saw ETC drop 57 percent to $14.00 (Feb. 6 low), and in this context, the rise to $32.90 marks the completion of a "V-shaped recovery.".

So far, the asset's investor community is associating the jump in prices with top forecaster Cryptonaire's decision to include ETC in the list of verified digital assets (VDA). Investors believe the move will likely generate more public interest in the cryptocurrency, resulting in a pickup in trading volumes..

However, the idea of a bitcoin ETF has received push-back from regulators who want to evaluate the potential risk they could present to investors. In response to that pushback, at least five companies have withdrawn their applications for a bitcoin ETF. As many as 10 bitcoin-linked ETFs are sitting in regulatory limbo, waiting for approval..

Bitcoin bulls risk losing control unless prices see a convincing break above the $9,000 mark soon, according to the technical charts..
`______ `____ `___ `_____ `______ `_____ `_____ `__ ` `_________ `____ `____ `__ `_____ `___ `____ `________ `_ `__ `________ `_______ 
Of concern is that the cryptocurrency has failed twice to hold above $8,900, as indicated by CoinDesks's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Further, bitcoin also clocked a six-day high of $9,070.64 on Feb. 10, but quickly fell back below the key psychological level of $9,000..

Thus, the area around the $9,000 mark has been established as a point of stiff resistance, as is being discussed by the investor community..
`____ `__ `___ `_____ `__ `_____ `___ `__ `___ `__________ `_ ` `____ `_ `____ `__________ `_ `_ `____ `________ `_ `__ `_______ `__________ 
As of writing, bitcoin's global average price on the BPI is at $8,390. The cryptocurrency has appreciated by at least 40 percent from the recent lows below $6,000. However, the bulls are still not out of the woods and need to move prices quickly above $9,000 or the bears could once more exert their influence..

That said, exhaustion around $9,000 has neutralized the immediate outlook and bearish revival is seen only below Feb. 2 low of $7,845..

`_ `________ `_________ `__ `_____ `____ `_ `_____ `______ `__ `_____ `____ `__ `____ `___ `_______ `_______ ` `____ `___ `____ `_______ 
A close above $9,000 would confirm an upside break of the falling channel, meaning bearish-to-bullish trend change. It would also add credence to the bullish 5-day MA and 10-day MA crossover and open doors for a move higher to $11,500-$11,800..

On the other hand, a close below $7,851 (Nov. 2 low) would signal the corrective rally from Feb. 6 low has ended and would encourage stronger sell-off to $5,000..

A candle appears to be closing above the descending channel resistance, and this is an early signal of a reversal from the short-term selloff. From here, bitcoin price could set its sights on the $11,000-12,000 area of interest next. This lines up with a former horizontal support and a broken rising trend line..

Already slashed by more than half since hitting a record near US$20,000 in December, the cryptocurrency could plunge a further 90% in an environment of unsustainably growing supply, according to Bloomberg Intelligence commodity strategist Mike McGlone. Using Amazon.com Inc and the Nasdaq Composite Index's spectacular rise and retreat at the turn of the millennium as a proxy, he said the currency could plunge to US$900..

While the creators of Bitcoin intended to limit supply to 21 million coins, forks mean that there are already more than 50 million outstanding coins based on the original blockchain. There's also nothing preventing rivals from spawning an infinite amount of clones, he said. The number of tradable cryptocurrencies jumped 120% in the past year..

Bitcoin's recovery from a low above $5,900 earlier this month was "impressive," according to the bank. Still, JPMorgan sees a "fairly high risk" of a sell-off towards the $4,605 level if the digital currency doesn't break through its resistance level between $10,128 and $10,776..

Price volatility is the main element preventing the faster penetration of cryptocurrencies to the real world. After hitting a record mark of $20,000 in mid-December 2017, Bitcoin's price fell below $7,000 at the beginning of February 2018. As a result, over $60 billion was wiped off the value of the entire cryptocurrency market..

Such fluctuations undermine the trust of investors and potential users of cryptocurrencies. Few people want to invest in an unstable asset, and it is also hard to use such a tool as a payment method or for remittance purposes due to constant price changes. As a result, cryptocurrencies are becoming just a niche for speculative traders, and the potential for this concept remains unrealized..

The team behind the Lightcash project aims to solve the cryptocurrency volatility problem and become able to unlock all the advantages of blockchain technology by linking a cryptocoin to the real highly-demanded asset.

"The Lightcash parent company owns a working gold mining facility in the Amur Region of Russia, as well as a plant for the enrichment of precious metals, and it possesses the necessary state licenses," says Vyacheslav Vokin, Lightcash CEO. "Using this infrastructure we will be able to ensure the stability of our service by issuing own cryptocoin secured by real gold in a 1000:1 ratio.".

Lightcash project closed pre-sale is scheduled for March 2, and the main token sale will take place on March 15.

He highlighted the digital currency's recent sell-off as a buying opportunity. While early last week bitcoin's market value was around $200 billion, it sank to $100 billion during this week's larger market plunge, slightly recovering toward the end of a week to a value of around $140 billion. At its lowest point this week, the Olympic rower and entrepreneur said investors could be looking at "a potential appreciation of 30 to 40 times because you look at the gold market today, it's a $7 trillion market. And so a lot of people are starting to see that, they recognize the store of value properties. So we think regardless of the price moves in the last few weeks, it's still a very underappreciated asset.".

"Cryptocurrencies have failed to become a payment system, the scope of their application is limited mainly to investments.

Besides the bearish news about tightening regulation by governments and banks, the situation for bitcoin is getting worse with the introduction of crypto trading on several large traditional exchanges, because it became easier for institutional investors to take short positions on bitcoin, the analyst says.

NVIDIA is preparing a new GTX 20 series of graphics cards that should debut with the purported GeForce GTX 2080 in April under the new Ampere GPU family, a refresh of the industry-leading Pascal GPU family released in 2016..
`_____ `_ `________ ` `__ `__ `_ `_____ `_ `_______ `____ `___ `_____ `____ `___ `__ `________ `______ `__ `___ `_ `____ `____ `__ `__ `_____ `__ `______ ` `______ `_ `__ `_______________ `_____ `__ `_____ `_______ `_ `_____ 
This reveal would see the new GeForce GTX 2080 revealed, which would have to pack more performance than the GTX 1080 from nearly two years ago. But how much faster can it be before it beats the GTX 1080 Ti? What if the new GTX 2080 could beat the GTX 1080 Ti at a price point of $599 but it is not capable of cryptocurrency mining?.
`___ `_____ `____ `__ `__ `__ `______ `__ `___ `________ `____ `____ `___ `_ `___ `___ `__________ `___ `__ `__ `___ `___ `_____ `__ `____ `___ `__ `__ `___ `_____ `__ `_ `_ `_____ `_ `____ `__ `__ `___ `__ `___ `_ `__ `__ `__ `___ `____ `___ `__ `__ `___ `_ `_ ` `____ `____ `_ `___ `__ `_ `_ `__ `______ `_ `_____________ `_______ 
NVIDIA will be shooting themselves in the foot with a refreshed GA104-based GeForce GTX 2080 that even comes close to the performance of the GTX 1080 Ti, because at that points gamers won't want to buy a graphics card from March 2017 when the new GTX 20 series is here. So NVIDIA has to find a way to make its GTX 1080 Ti relevant in a market where the GTX 2080 is out, and that could be from a GPU-level ban of crypto mining on the GTX 20 series cards..
`_____ `___ `_ `_______ `_________ `_ `__ `___ `___ ` `________ `__________ `______ `__ `___ `___ `___ `____ `____ `_ `__ `__________ `_ `__ `__ `___ `__ `______ `_ `___ `_____ `_____ `____ `___ `_ `__ ` `_______ `___ `___ `____ `___ `___ `__ `__ `__ `_ `_____ `_ `____ `_ `_____ `__ `_ `___ ` `__ `_ `___ `__ `__ `___ `_ `_______ `_ ` `_____ `____ `__ `__ `___ `_ `___ `__ `___ `____ `_ `___ ` `________ `__ `_ `_____ `_____ `_ `__ `__ `_ `_____ `______ 
I don't think this purported ban on crypto mining on the GTX 20 series would last long, but 6-12 months would be enough time for NVIDIA to deplete its entire GTX 10 stock worldwide. NVIDIA has a considerable supply of cards on the market, with many more coming, and they're selling all of them. With a GPU-level crypto mining ban on the GTX 20 series, this would allow the GTX 10 series cards to cater to gamers who want to mine and game, or to miners who just want those important hashes..

After 6-12 months of the release of the new GeForce GTX 2080, NVIDIA would need to announce and release the GTX 2080 Ti. At this time, NVIDIA would have enough GTX 10 series cards sold, and enough GTX 20 series inventory to announce at the GTX 2080 Ti reveal event that they are unlocking mining on the GTX 20 series..

This is purely my opinion, but it'll be enough to start an online comment fest between you guys and girls - our readers, and the companies and my sources involved. This would be an interesting step to take, and an easy way for NVIDIA to keep GTX 20 series stock under control in a mining-obsessed market..

This is what has happened to Italian cryptocurrency exchange BitGrail, with the company announcing on its website that it has lost $170 million to fraudulent transactions, and that they've approached authorities over the matter. BitGrail has since suspended all withdrawals and deposits "in order to conduct further verifications"..

BitGrail has said that it won't be refunding 100% of what users' lost, with BitGrail founder Francesco "The Bomber" Firano saying that there's no 100% way to refund users. Firano took to Twitter, where he tweeted: "Unfortunately there is no way to give it back to you at 100% (we only got 4 MLN XRN right now)"..

This semester, graduate-level courses are available at Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, Duke, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Maryland, among other schools.

David Yermack, a business and law professor at New York University, began offering one of the first for-credit courses on the topic back in 2014: "There was some gentle ribbing from my colleagues when I began giving talks on Bitcoin," he said. "But within a few months, I was being invited to Basel to talk with central bankers, and the joking from my colleagues stopped after that.".

Last month, students packed in to hear the first lecture of "Blockchain, Cryptoeconomics and the Future of Technology, Business and Law," which considered the development of Bitcoin against the history of money. For his class this semester, Mr. Yermack originally booked a lecture hall that could fit 180 students, but he had to move the course to the largest lecture hall at N.Y.U. when enrollment kept going up -- he now has 225 students on board..

Ahead of the report, some analysts were worried Nvidia would have trouble showing it could sustain growth outside of its graphics division. Cryptocurrency miners contributed about $US70 million in sales during the third quarter, and Steves estimates the miners added about $US180 million in sales during the fourth quarter..

AMD, Nvidia's main rival in the space, said about one-third of its graphics division growth came from cryptocurrency miners, which led some investors to worry if the company would be growing without the wildly volatile cryptocurrency market. After it's earnings report, it looks like Nvidia isn't facing the same problems..

The one blip in Nvidia's stellar report came from the sluggish growth in its automotive division. Nvidia's chips for power infotainment systems and self-driving cars are off to a slow start, but the company could just be a bit too far ahead of the curve, Steves said. In a couple years, when autonomous cars become more popular and more advanced, the 3% growth will start to be a bigger problem..

Nvidia reported earnings for the fourth-quarter 2017, noting that not only did the company benefit extensively from U.S. tax reform, but also the boom in demand for its Pascal-generation graphics cards. This was mainly due to an increase in cryptocurrency mining during the period, as the Bitcoin price surged. Its excitement surrounding the increase in revenues remain at odds with previous statements, claiming that it would work with retailers to curb sales of its consumer products to miners..

The company reported an increase of 34% in revenue terms compared to the same period a year prior. These results exceeded analyst's expectations, with gaming - the biggest category - contributing $1.74 billion in revenue. Nvidia launched the $3,000 Titan V during the quarter, in addition to the GeForce Now program that is currently in beta. Second to the aforementioned category was its Data Center products, with this adding another $606 million to its overall earnings..

Net income for Nvidia was up 71% year-on-year, coming in at $1.118 billion. It also reported a net income for the fiscal year of $3.04 billion, which itself was up 83%.

For a fleeting moment, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, whom Mark Zuckerberg once promise to "f--k . . . probably in the ear" over their claim that Facebook was, in fact, their brainchild, achieved their comeuppance. While Zuck's company floundered, pinioned in the crosshairs of angry lawmakers and increasingly skeptical users, and quickly losing eyeballs, their early bitcoin investments catapulted them into the ranks of billionaires, landing them on Forbes latest iteration of its rich list: "The Richest People in Cryptocurrency," published Tuesday..

But there's just one problem with the list, and it's directly tied to the problem inherent to the currencies themselves: the market is too volatile to be sustaining, and so are the fortunes of those who have profited from it. As soon as the list was published, major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin saw their values plummet, rendering it immediately out of date. As The New York Times noted, even though the magazine identified about 10 billionaires, many were no longer billionaires once the list went live:.

Unlike an ordinary list of billionaires whose fortunes are tied up in stocks, bitcoin billionaires (or millionaires, as it were) don't have to disclose who they are, much less their holdings. While Forbes's list is based on confirmed numbers and quantifiable data, it's also necessarily based on guesswork, thanks to the secretive and often paranoid nature of its users. And as the cryptocurrency market becomes more complex, and more like existing financial markets, it is only becoming more volatile. As of Thursday, bitcoin's price hovered just above $8,000, far below its December peak of $19,000..

Fortunately for the Winklevii twins, Larsen, and the rest of the members of Forbes's cryptocurrency list, the erratic nature of the most popular virtual currencies probably means they'll all regain billionaire status soon, if they haven't already. Cameron Winklevoss is certainly looking on the bright side: "If you look at a $100 billion market cap today, now last week it might have been more like 200, so it's actually a buying opportunity, we think that there's a potential appreciation of 30 to 40 times," he told CNBC on Wednesday. "A lot of people are starting to see that, they recognize the store of value properties. So we think regardless of the price moves in the last few weeks, it's still a very underappreciated asset.".

PDVSA is due to receive two cargoes full of American crude from China and two other vessels full of Russian Urals crude from Glencore in the coming weeks, the documents said. The per-barrel cost for all of the shipments will be at $66 per barrel, which is slightly above market rates, but cash payments from Venezuela are few and far between. Instead, PDVSA has agreed to deliver fuel oil and heavy crude in exchange for the imported oil..

Falling oil production and tough economic sanctions have increased pressures on the nation's financial capacity. Mismanagement and underinvestment in the country's oil and gas industry is causing defunct facilities to produce low quality oil that does not meet the requirements of its usual buyers. Venezuela's production is falling faster that high barrel prices can fill the revenue gap, the credit rating agency added..
