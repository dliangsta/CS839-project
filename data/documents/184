"Stellar is an online cryptocurrency system that uses Lumens as units of value\n\nSTELLAR is one of a host of cryptocurrencies springing up in the wake of Bitcoin's roaring popularity among amateur and professional investors.\n\nBut how much is it worth, how do you invest in it and how does it work?\n\nStellar describes itself as a \"distributed, hybrid blockchain\" allowing transfers of value \"for a fraction of a cent\".\n\nSimilar to Bitcoin, it can work as a decentralised currency whose value is not based on anything tangible - just the value that investors place on it.\n\nThe digital currency is based on Lumens - one Lumen is one unit of the currency and has the shorthand name XLM.\n\nLumens are available for purchase on several known markets and exchanges.\n\nBut users should be aware that there is a risk in investing in digital currency as the prices can fluctuate wildly and could lose value completely.\n\nThey are also not insured by regulatory bodies.\n\nThe trading price of a Lumen can be measured on several cryptocurrency monitors.\n\nAs of February 12, 2018, Lumen is priced at $0.38 (\u00a30.27).\n\nSo far, more than 8billion Lumens have been distributed across the world.\n\nThe legal status of cryptocurrencies varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them.\n\nAnyone thinking of investing in Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency should be very careful.\n\nTheir values are volatile, with the ability to plummet as quickly as they shoot up.\n\nAnd investors are frequently targeted by hackers and other criminals who seek to steal their crypto-cash online.\n\nBe especially careful if you are using direct, peer-to-peer platforms to sell and buy cryptocurrencies.\n\nThese are the equivalent of something like Gumtree - you never know who you might be dealing with."
