"LONDON, February 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\n\nUpset that you missed the boat on the bitcoin craze last year? Millionaires were minted overnight as bitcoin returned 1,700 percent in 2017, only to see prices crash by more than half since December. The bubble seems to have popped, and not everyone got out in time. Included in today's commentary: Pure Storage Inc (NYSE: PSTG), Secureworks Corp (NASDAQ: SCWX), Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN), Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE: SNE), Veeva (NYSE: VEEV)\n\nWhile we may be past the peak temporarily, the cryptocurrency trend is just getting started, and investor enthusiasm is still growing by the day.\n\nWhile the bitcoin investment boat may have already set sail, it's likely far from the last huge opportunity in the space. The cryptocurrency and blockchain market is expanding at a significant rate, and there is one unique and simple investment opportunity that could give investors access to a broad spectrum of the space.\n\nGlobal Blockchain Technologies Corp. (BLOC; BLKCF) is Canada's first blockchain-focused investment company. Bitcoin captured the interest of the global financial industry last year, but it makes up just a fraction of the blockchain market. The recent collapse in bitcoin prices now has some investors nursing their losses and biding their time until the next big cryptocurrency coin emerges.\n\nMore importantly, the underlying blockchain technology is an even bigger story than mere crypto tokens.\n\nGlobal Blockchain offers the best of both worlds. It offers investors exposure to a curated selection of cryptocurrencies, while also opening the door to investment in blockchain, before the next wave of money rolls into this booming market.\n\nAs investors search for profits amid the market disruption caused by cryptocurrencies, Global Blockchain plans to offer a unique solution. This comes in the form of a basket of holdings that:\n\nDefinitively answers massive demand from investors Will be one of the first ways to find and gain exposure to a wide breadth of cryptocurrencies and blockchain companies Is packaged in a publicly listed security accessible in the U.S., Canada and Europe, with Asia and Australia to follow Access to ICOs that investors would never be able to secure on their own Is led by major crypto-pioneers who are ready to make the crypto world a lot less cryptic\n\nHere are 5 reasons to keep a close eye on Global Blockchain (BLOC; BLKCF), an investment company hoping to become the first-ever vertically integrated originator and manager of startup blockchains and investor in top-tier digital currencies:\n\n1.) Blockchain To Impact Every Major Sector of the Global Economy\n\nBlockchain is automation and collaboration on steroids, with market growth predictions headed into trillion-dollar territory. The technology is the backbone of the exploding crypto-currency market, worth a pretty $333 billion today.\n\nThere's likely no industry that's isolated from being disrupted by blockchain technology.\n\nBanking: Seven major global banks have partnered with fintech companies to develop new blockchain technologies, because blockchain and cryptocurrencies simplify so many things in the banking world, from fees for sending payments through middlemen, privacy threats, and security risks to cumbersome lending in the $134-trillion global banking industry. Global Logistics: Blockchain technology is already being used to track global trade and shipments in this $8-trillion-plus industry. Real Estate: This $7.4-trillion industry is also a major beneficiary of blockchain tech. Look no further than the real estate mecca of Dubai, which is putting its entire land registry on a blockchain. Healthcare: The global healthcare IT market, valued at $134 billion last year, is publicly seeking IT solutions from Blockchain. Crowdfunding: Even this $96-billion market is embracing blockchain.\n\nAnd the list goes on\n\n\"Blockchain solutions in finance are virtually endless ... any centralized marketplace that is dominated by a few middlemen is likely to be taken over by blockchain technology,\" says BLOC Chairman Steve Nerayoff. The opportunities are mind-boggling.\n\n2.) BLOC Offers Exposure to Blockchain Ecosystem\n\nGlobal Blockchain (BLOC; BLKCF) has plans to invest in a basket of holdings within the blockchain space, offering investors a slice of profits from the entire shift towards blockchain tech. This innovative strategy would make Global Blockchain the first global investment company with exposure to a wide cross-section of the blockchain ecosystem - all backed by startup equity and token diversification.\n\nThe investment strategy also benefits from diversification, lowering risk for investors by balancing more established companies with hand-picked, high-growth potential small-caps. Global Blockchain also plans to diversify portfolios by balancing cryptocurrencies by category.\n\nYou can buy it right now from an online broker, and even add it to your IRA or 401K.\n\n3.) BLOC Led by Cryptocurrency Pioneers\n\nThe team behind Global Blockchain (BLOC; BLKCF) isn't comprised of a bunch of financiers new to cryptocurrencies.\n\nRemember the Ethereum ICO? It's risen over 220,000 percent. Global Blockchain's Chairman and CEO, Steve Nerayoff, was not only a senior advisor to Ethereum leading up to its ICO, but was the architect of the Ethereum crowdsale, the way the project was funded. He also was a senior advisor to the Lisk Cryptocurrency project, which now has a $1.8-billion market cap. Nerayoff is an early leader of the blockchain industry, and one of its most important pioneers.\n\nBut Global Blockchain's knowledge base doesn't stop with Nerayoff.\n\nRik Willard: Cryptocurrency and ICO veteran, co-founder of the Silicon Valley Blockchain Society, and an advisor to Luxembourg and other countries' blockchain initiatives. Shidan Gouran: Cryptocurrency and ICO expert with a long track record. Kyle Kemper: Executive director of the Blockchain Association of Canada. Jeff Pulver: Has consulted and invested in 350 startups. Michael Terpin: Co-founder of BitAngels, the world's first angel network for digital currency startups. Managing partner of bCommerce Labs, the world's first blockchain incubator fund. Founded Marketwire, one of the largest company newswires, which was acquired in 2006 by NASDAQ for $200 million.\n\nAnd it's not just their blockchain successes and expertise that investors will harness - it's also their exclusive access to assets that investors would have difficulty investing in otherwise.\n\n4.) Just The Beginning\n\nIf and when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves crypto ETFs for listing on public markets, digital currencies will likely push even higher. Some projections show that as much as $300 million could pour into a bitcoin ETF in its first week, Bloomberg reports.\n\nWe're looking at a potential total current market cap of tokens at $34 billion, and more than $2 billion has already flowed into ICO (initial coin offering) token sales. This is where Global Blockchain (BLOC; BLKCF) comes into play, with their expertise to make knowledge-based decisions on which ICOs may have what it takes to be winners, and how to play the futures. They also intend to balance large-cap holdings with small-cap and emerging cryptocurrencies so investors can benefit from the relative stability of one and the growth potential of the other at the same time.\n\nGlobal Blockchain plans to become an incubator for new crypto technologies, which means that investors are not just investing in assets - they're investing in innovation.\n\n5.) Global Blockchain Cryptocurrency Incubator\n\nGlobal Blockchain (BLOC; BLKCF) also plans to create additional value with its own incubator for new tokens, taking advantage of a major gap in the token world.\n\nMost new ICOs have poor execution after they are developed. This is where Global Blockchain sees an opportunity. They won't just help new blockchain companies build; they'll help brand and distribute, taking equity stakes in the cryptocurrency in return.\n\nWhile the major cryptocurrencies garner the most attention, sometimes the smaller tokens offer vastly more upside. Verge, for instance, with a market cap of $640 million, has offered a return on investment in excess of 200,000 percent. DigitalNote, a small token with a market cap of just $97 million, have offered investors a return on investment higher than 13,000 percent.\n\nGlobal Blockchain will find and incubate upstart cryptocurrencies so you won't have to try to discover them yourself.\n\nNew waves of money continue to enter the market, and the next wave could be Wall Street hedge funds. After that, possibly ETFs. And then everyone else. Getting ahead of the wave could be possible with Global Blockchain's investment and incubator strategy.\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\nVeeva (NYSE: VEEV) Veeva is one of the most prominent cloud services providers out there, focusing specifically on the pharmaceutical sector. The company's cloud platform for the world's pharma companies is more popular than ever before. After rallying to an all-time high last July, its share price has fallen a bit since.\n\nSony Corp (ADR) (NYSE: SNE) is a tech heavyweight. From TVs to video games, Sony covers anything and everything media-related. The company's infamous Walkman was in the hands of every young person throughout the 1980s and 1990s. But Sony's biggest hit was arguably the PlayStation gaming console.\n\nRaytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) is an emerging tech company specializing in defense and other government markets. Raytheon's major selling point is its strong command of cybersecurity. While its specialty is in government-centric markets, Raytheon also develops products, services, and solutions in various other markets.\n\nSecureworks Corp (NASDAQ: SCWX) Secureworks Corp is a company specializing in intelligence-driven information security solutions. Clients are protected from cyber-attacks including hacking, ransomware, and the like. The company's solutions enable its clients to strengthen their defenses in order to prevent security breaches and detect malicious activity in real time.\n\nPure Storage Inc (NYSE: PSTG) Data platforms are also a key asset in protecting companies against cyber-attacks. Pure Storage, Inc is a data platform focused on delivering fast, optimized and cloud-capable solutions for its customers while keeping data security as a top priority. This is another company about which investors can be optimistic.\n\nBy. Meredith Taylor\n\n**IMPORTANT! BY READING OUR CONTENT YOU EXPLICITLY AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING.
