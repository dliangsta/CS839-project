Don't put in more money than you can afford to lose. If you're trying to figure out where to store your life savings, traditional assets are still your safest bet.\n\n-- Vitalik Buterin (@VitalikButerin) February 17, 2018\n\nAt this time in February of last year, Ethereum was priced at less than $13. Now it's sitting at about $930 after hitting a high of more than $1,300 before experiencing a dramatic crash in which its value almost halved.\n\nYou'd be forgiven for feeling rather confused about the mixed messages coming from the cryptocurrency world, which alternates between wild orgies of optimism and sullen spells of morbid doom-mongering.\n\nThe sad truth of the matter is that no-one can predict the future of cryptocurrencies and foresee whether they will turn out to be the future of finance, or just a disastrous bubble which will pop and leave millions of people in financial ruin.\n\nFor evidence of this, you just need to look at the fortunes of the major forms of digital dosh.\n\nSince the beginning of 2018, we've seen the price of Bitcoin and other virtual coins plunge in a crash which was dubbed the cryptopocalypse.\n\nYet last year, the price of Bitcoin swelled by almost 2000% and other cryptocurrencies including Ethereum followed suit.\n\nOne analyst who claims to have spotted a pattern in the famously unpredictable behaviour of the Bitcoin market said its price will double in the next six months.\n\nWhich is totally different to the warning from one bigwig at Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, who said Bitcoin investors 'should be prepared to lose all their money'.\n\nAnyone who can accurately foresee cryptocurrency price changes stands to become extremely wealthy, profiting by purchasing virtual coins when the price is low and then selling high.\n\nBut Bitcoin, Ethereum and all the other cryptocurrencies are famously volatile, meaning that foolproof predictions are impossible.\n\nAt the moment, crypto-commentators seem pretty optimistic.\n\nLast week, Thomas Lee, managing partner at the financial research firm Fundstrat Global Advisors, said the expected to see a new record peak for Bitcoin by July, based on analysis of the currency's 22 corrections since 2010.\n\nThe original cryptocurrency jumped in value by more than 1,300 percent last year, hitting a record peak of almost $20,000 on December 17 before plunging by 70%.\n\nHe said: 'Bitcoin recoveries take 1.7 times the duration of the decline and this implies that 85 days are needed to recover prior highs.\n\n'This is July 2018.'\n\nBut all this happiness could dissolve in a second if we experience another 'Bitcoin blood bath'.\n\nWe'd advise all cryptocurrency investors to proceed with extreme caution."
