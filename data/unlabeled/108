"Bitcoin found itself in a struggle to hold on to $10,000 early Friday, slipping below that mark even as one prominent analyst predicted the No. 1 cryptocurrency was headed for a summer bounce.\n\nBitcoin BTCUSD, +0.57% was down 2.4% to $9,773.77, having traded between an intraday high of $10,293.44 and a low of $9,760.21, according to CoinDesk. The weakness comes a day after bitcoin pushed back above the psychologically important level of $10,000 for the first time since early February.\n\nSince the start of the year, bitcoin has lost about 26% of its value, with renewed concerns about regulation haunting cryptocurrencies. However, a noted bull for bitcoin, Tom Lee, managing partner and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, has predicted that the cryptocurrency will revisit record highs by July 2018.\n\nRead: Coinbase admits glitch that overcharged crypto customers, promises refunds\n\nIn fresh research, Lee examined 22 pullbacks of more than 20% for bitcoin, finding that recoveries tend to take about 1.7 times the duration of a pullback. He said $9,000 should mark the major low for bitcoin.\n\n\"In general, we see 2018 being a strong year but we see the larger and more established blockchains growing in dominance in 2018 -- hence, better upside for ETH and BTC over the FS CryptoFX indices,\" Lee said\n\nLee, considered a bitcoin bull, in January predicted the cryptocurrency would hit $25,000 by the end of this year, and $125,000 by 2022, according to his model for valuing of bitcoin. Lee became cautious on the cryptocurrency in October as it shot past his bullish forecast of $6,000, but then turned bullish again in November.\n\nLee maintains his year-end price target of $25,000, and sees it hitting $20,000 by mid-2018.\n\nBitcoin has also moved up as global equities have regained their footing after a sharp pullback a week ago.\n\nThe Fundstrat analyst isn't the only one upbeat on bitcoin.\n\nLee Wild, head of equity strategy at Interactive Investor, said \"Bitcoin's spectacular crash from near $20,000 to just $6,000 in less than two months is seen as a great time to pick up cheap coins,\" in a client note. \"Regulatory interference is finally being accepted as a sign of maturity and a positive development for this new asset class, rather than a threat,\" he said.\n\nRead: Coinbase admits glitch that overcharged crypto customers, promises refunds\n\nElsewhere in the cryptocurrency universe, Bitcoin Cash has jumped 8.8% to $1,496.33.
