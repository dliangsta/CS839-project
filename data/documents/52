"February 14th, 2018 - Wild Crypto (SYMBOL: WILD), the revolutionary international lottery and eGaming platform built upon blockchain technology, has gone live following last year's successful token sale.\n\nThe platform is the first of the major new cryptocurrency gaming projects to launch, and does so just four months after it raised 10,592 in Ether during a ground-breaking token sale.\n\nWild Crypto offers a range of lottery, slots and bingo games, where players can stake WILD tokens for the chance of winning prizes. These include a first lottery draw offering a one million WILD token jackpot.\n\nWilliam Trentini, CEO, Wild Crypto, said: \"While other fundraised blockchain gaming platforms are taking years to deliver, Wild Crypto has delivered an innovative, game-changing product in just four months.\n\n\"Our early investors have already enjoyed a wild ride, but now we are live we look forward to delivering an ever-improving gaming experience to our customers.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, the price of WILD tokens has soared in anticipation of the launch, but are still trading on exchanges such as Cryptopia at quite undervalued prices.\n\nHowever, WILD tokens will be sold on the Wild Crypto platform at 100 per 1 Ether, giving each token a value of around $8 in today's market.\n\nThe Wild Crypto platform, which is regulated via a Cura\u00e7ao license, is delivered by regulated lottery specialist Twelve40, which supplies the certified back-end game technology for the new platform.\n\nWild Crypto (SYMBOL: WILD) is the developer of a disruptive, international lottery and eGaming platform built upon blockchain technology."
