Go big or go home. That's the motto of one mysterious investor who put his chips on the table, buying close to $400 million of the No.1 digital currency, bitcoin.. The purchase comes as cryptocurrencies are making a comeback after a dreadful start to 2018. Major digital currencies lost as much as 50% to start the year as growing regulation and security fears crippled the market, seeing traders bail on their positions. However, the tide has turned..

"However, I am willing to believe that, seeing bitcoin bottom around $6,000, Wall Street smelled blood and jumped back in," he said.. With bitcoin back above $10,000, the owner of the address is closing is on the bitcoin billionaires club..
