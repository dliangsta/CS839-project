(Nasdaq: MSFT) also offered a boost to the global cryptocurrency market today with the announcement that it will embrace blockchain technology to improve security challenges and identity confusion.\n\n\"After examining decentralized storage systems, consensus protocols, blockchains, and a variety of emerging standards we believe blockchain technology and protocols are well suited for enabling decentralized IDs,\" the firm said.\n\nIt was the hottest cryptocurrency in the market on Monday, surging more than 100%.\n\nThat pushed the little-known cryptocurrency into the top 25 by market capitalization.\n\nMust Read: 5 Cryptocurrencies to Watch in 2018 Under $10\n\nBut today, some investors are paying the price for the \"pump.\"\n\nU.CASH cratered another 40.2% over the last 24 hours in a dramatic sell-off.
