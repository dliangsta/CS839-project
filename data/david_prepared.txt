Wall Street is known for being a cut throat place where shrewd business people play as tough as possible in order to make gains or their destroy opponents. However, the crypto ecosystem can be at times far more nasty than any other market. One company that had the audacity to rate everyone's favorite cryptocurrency somewhat poorly learned this recently, but it still stands by the rankings..

Weiss Ratings, an independent U.S. rating agency which recently issued letter grades for cryptocurrencies has published a new report to explain its decision to score bitcoin a mere C+ ("fair")..

The company obviously felt it needed to counter attack against critics after its rankings caused it to get hurled insults from many cryptocurrency people and opinion leaders on social media. It even suffered a cyber attack which took down the Weiss site temporarily. The 14-page report is meant to answer the outcry by revealing key factors and data behind the rating..

"For investors," explains Weiss Ratings founder Martin D. Weiss, PhD, "an A rated crypto would be one that rarely crashes, and right now, there's no such thing. But we do understand where developers are coming from. They tell us they don't care about market fluctuations. They feel our ratings should reflect strictly the quality of their work and its relative success in the real world.".

Aiming to address both investors and developers, the Weiss model combines a number of sub-models: Risk and Reward, adapted from its stock and ETF ratings, plus Fundamentals and Technology, which are unique to cryptocurrencies. Here's how they determined bitcoin performs on each:.

`___ `__ `______________ `________ `___ `_______ `___ `___ `___ `______ `_________ `____ `_________ `_ `_________ `__ `___ `_ `______ `____________ 
Fundamentals-"Due credit is given for adoption and security, but Bitcoin loses points on network congestion with just four transactions per second and high fees of about $10 per transaction. In addition, the top five miners control some 70% of total hashpower, also a negative.".

Technology-"Bitcoin lacks the governance needed for prompt upgrades and is falling behind in a rapidly evolving industry.".
`__________________ `____ `__ `_________ `_____ `__ `_____ `_______ `__ `_ `______ `_____ `_ ` `______ `_______ `__________ 
Another criticism that was leveled at the agency is that Weiss overweights price volatility. "Not so," he says. "Our model accurately reflects an inconvenient truth about the market's extreme swings. But our ratings are continually updated. If prices stabilize or speed enhancements are rolled out successfully, an upgrade is possible.".

According to a tweet, a bitcoin address bought almost $1 billion worth of bitcoin during a dip in its prices recently. The buyer first bought bitcoin worth $344 million between February 9 and February 12, when its price traversed the range between $8,500 and $8,900. The buyer doubled down on bitcoin by purchasing 41,000 coins, just before its price hit $10,000..

Among the top 10 most-traded cryptocurrencies, bitcoin cash was the biggest gainer and moved up by 11.32% from its price 24 hours ago. After rallying for two days, crypto markets mostly moved sideways this morning. At 15:11 UTC, they had a total market cap of $481 billion, up from $468 billion earlier this morning..

As the original cryptocurrency, bitcoin's price has mostly correlated with other coins. Or so it is assumed. According to analysis by Bloomberg, bitcoin's price correlation with other cryptos "broke down" when it rallied. But a fall in crypto prices re-established the lockstep movement..

In quantitative terms, bitcoin's price had a correlation of 0.57 with other cryptocurrencies when prices tumbled. When they rose, it declined to 0.19. A correlation of 1 translates to synchronous movements. This is interesting analysis for traders interested in diversifying their funds away from bitcoin towards other coins.

Speaking with CNBC, Rob Joyce, special assistant to the President and White House cybersecurity coordinator, said there's a long way to go before the U.S. government starts regulating Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Joyce emphasized the need to better understand the cryptocurrency's risks and benefits before moving forward with any sort of regulation: "I think we're still absolutely studying and understanding what the good ideas and bad ideas in that space are," he said when asked about the potential for government regulation. "So, I don't think it's close.".

Bitcoin is a decentralized and digital, and unlike fiat currencies such as the dollar it's not backed by a central authority. And as transactions are anonymous, the coin has been accused of making it easier for those engaged in illicit activities to hide their money. But this ability that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offer to avoid traditional restrictions on money and assets is part of what makes it so popular to those who use it. That decentralization is also much of the reason its price swings so wildly..

"We are worried. There are benefits to the Bitcoin concept -- digital cash, digital currencies," Joyce said. "But at the same time, if you look at the way Bitcoin works after there is a criminal act that takes place, you can't rewind the clock and take back that currency." Joyce described the inherent problem with this lack of a trail, noting that in the case of credit card theft, for instance, individuals or companies can contact their banks and purchases can be undone and the cash retrieved..

"The SEC's trading suspension orders state that recent press releases issued by CHIT, PDXP and VICT claimed that the companies acquired AAA-rated assets from a subsidiary of a private equity investor in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, among other things.

The Securities and Exchange Commission suspended trading on Friday in Cherubim Interests, Inc. CHIT, -25.00% PDX Partners, Inc. PDXP, -8.16% and Victura Construction Group, Inc. VICT, +4.55% because of questions surrounding similar statements they made about the acquisition of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology-related assets. The SEC said recent press releases issued by the three companies claimed that the companies acquired AAA-rated assets from a subsidiary of a private equity investor in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, among other things. Cherubim Interests, Inc. also announced the execution of a financing commitment to launch an initial coin offering. The SEC has questions regarding the nature of the companies' business operations and the value of their assets, including in press releases issued beginning in early January 2018. The SEC also said Cherubim Interests, Inc is delinquent in filing annual and quarterly reports. The SEC has been warning investors to be on alert for companies that may publicly announce ICO or coin/token related events for the sole purpose of moving the price of the company's common stock..

On Thursday, the digital currency touched crossed $9,000 - a psychologically key level for the virtual currency. However, Bitcoin is still far from reaching the figure of $19,783 that it touched on December 17, 2017. Bitcoin was under intense pressure in the last two months amid a series of negative headlines around increased scrutiny by regulators worldwide. However, sentiments related to Bitcoin have improved substantially over the last few weeks. Even in India, Reserve Bank has issued repeated warnings to the investors who have invested in digital currencies especially Bitcoin. In the budget 2018 speech, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that cryptocurrency is not a legal tender in India. However, the government will explore blockchain to usher in the digital economy, he said..

The rise in Bitcoin last year has almost coincided with the bull rally observed in the global stock markets, Reuters quoted Miles Eakers, chief market analyst, at FX brokerage Centtrip saying. Just like Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies namely Ethereum and Ripple also surged in the last few weeks. Bitcoin's rise to $10,000, first time in more than 2 weeks, has raised hopes among the investors as they purchased back the virtual currency after it fell 70 percent from the all-time high reported in mid-December..

As Bitcoin observed a steady recovery, Yves Mersch, European Central Bank executive board member, issued a warning during his speech in Paris that Bitcoin is a speculative digital asset, Market News International reported. These currencies are devoid of any trusted issuer and hence, will become worthless at any point in time, he added. There is no surprise that these digital currencies are not accepted widely as means of payment, he further said. Nouriel Roubini, the famous American economist who rightly predicted the housing crash of 2008 in the US, had termed Bitcoin mania as mother of all bubbles that will burst anytime soon..

AMD's new processors provide a great performance at a budget price..

`__ `__ `____ ` `____ `_____ ` `____ ` `_______ `___ ` `___ `____ `_ `_____ `_______ `_ `_ `______ `__ `____ `__ `___ ` `___________ `_ `__ `_______ `_____ 
Both processors offer impressive pricing at £149.99 ($169) and £89.99 ($99) respectively and are placed nicely in the entry level space for gamers or creators on a budget, as these chips are going to punch well above their weight in terms of price/performance..

AMD vs Intel - what is the best for you?.
`__ `_ `____ ` `___ `_ `__ `___ `__ `____ 
It's an interesting move as the Ryzen 3 and 5 lines are certainly mid-range processors and the power they can put out is nothing to be sniffed at, especially when the price is taken into consideration..

While this move would make a lot of sense for laptop based hardware, one would think anyone putting together a desktop system and buying a Ryzen 5 would also be purchasing a graphics card along with it - as anything you'd want a Ryzen 5 for would probably need a stand-alone graphics card as well..

On the other hand, considering the price of graphics cards at the moment is so high due to cryptocurrency mining, these new processors could do extremely well for people who are looking for a budget desktop that they can play some games on..

Is it worth picking one up now? As ever, that depends on your budget - if you want a modest gaming PC to play League of Legends, Hearthstone, or another game that isn't going to be too graphically intensive then this will be ideal for you. However, don't expect to run PUBG or any of the latest AAA title on max settings..

If you don't want to buy a stand-alone graphics card at the moment (which is very understandable) then this could be a good short term solution while you wait for the prices to drop back down to something more reasonable..

Also known as Spring Festival and Lunar New Year, Chinese New Year is the most important holiday in China. For 2018, the festivities officially started on Friday, Feb. 16., which marks the beginning of the Year of the Dog. It is considered to be East Asia's most important holiday season..

Given that so many chose Bitcoin to grow their financial coffers, many have plenty of extra of money to spend thanks to the crypto's meteoric rise in 2017. There is a train of thought that so many crypto holders cashed out of their investments to have money to buy gifts that it caused Bitcoin's price to tumble..

It's interesting that Chinese New Year spending can be correlated with Bitcoin's price crash because so many were cashing out their positions. While that's slightly plausible, it cannot be chalked up to be the main culprit behind Bitcoin's price fall. Bitcoin, the face of the cryptocurrency space, slid from around $17,000 at the beginning of the year to less than $5,900 a month later.

Many believe the fall was a long time in the making considering Bitcoin's lightning speed take off from $1,000 at the beginning of 2017, to $20,000 at the end of 2017. A correction was long overdue..

Moody's - CME Group Inc. (CME, Aa3 stable) and Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe, Baa1 positive) recent launch of Bitcoin Futures contracts is not anticipated to affect the creditworthiness of either entity, owing to strong risk management at central counterparty clearing houses (CCPs), low futures' volumes and the futures' exchanges conservative approach to managing Bitcoin exposure, Moody's Investors Service says in a new report. The price volatility of Bitcoin presents risk management challenges for CCPs which makes it more difficult to close out a defaulting clearing member's exposures. To manage this risk, both CME and Cboe set relatively high margins for Bitcoin futures trades to mitigate counterparty exposure, and have increased margin requirements from those they first presented to regulators in October 2017. "We expect the CME and Cboe to make conservative adjustments to these margins in response to changing market conditions -- namely, a sudden rise in the volatility of Bitcoin prices -- as a risk and credit control measure," Moody's Analyst Fadi Abdel Massih says. Risk is contained for retail brokers as well..

The firms that offer the products, such as TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (TD Ameritrade, A2 stable) and E*TRADE Financial Corp. (E*TRADE, Baa3 review for upgrade) maintain conservative policies and margining to account for Bitcoin's high price volatility. The cautious approach from retail brokers includes pre-qualification for customers to trade Bitcoin futures as well as an adherence to high margins. This risk management tool protects the brokers' exposure at the clearing house in a scenario where a customer defaults on a position. "The margin that a broker requires from its customers is typically at least 10% more than the margin required by the clearing house from the broker, an important risk mitigation," Massih says..

However, operational risk is introduced to the underlying price of future contracts due to the use of unseasoned cryptocurrency spot exchanges. CME and Cboe use different methodologies to determine the reference rate for Bitcoin futures, and they both rely for price discovery on newly established cryptocurrency exchanges that have historically lacked meaningful regulatory oversight..

"I try not to check [cryptocurrency prices] more than once a day," Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, commented on the wild fluctuations of cryptocurrencies lately in an interview with Bloomberg on Wednesday after the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco..

Like many cryptocurrency advocates' unconvincing views on the matter, Garlinghouse said digital currencies are an emerging asset class that should be treated as a long-term investment rather than speculative gambling..

"At its core, all of this comes down to if we are solving real problems for real customers. If the cryptocurrency market overall or a digital asset is solving a problem, it's going to drive some value," Garlinghouse said..

As such, it's not surprising that Ripple, in stark contrast with rival cryptocurrency companies, highly values its relationships with governments and central banks. The central banks of England (The Bank of England) and Saudi Arabia (Saudi Arabia Monetary Authority) have both signed partnerships with Ripple to install its blockchain software to process international transactions..

The price of Bitcoin appears to be recovering well from the dramatic fall it experienced at the end of last year. The cost to buy a single unit of the world's most popular cryptocurrency reached a two week high on Thursday, topping out at just above the $10,000 point. The second time passing, the five-digit psychological barrier seemed to offer little resistance as the price barely paused between $9,000 and the two week high..

The recent price surge seems largely driven by various news events clearing the fear and uncertainty surrounding the space of late. So far in 2018, doubt was cast over the market thanks to South Korea's musing over a cryptocurrency ban. The government there had mentioned the possibility of them taking such a harsh step but have since stated that there is no intention to eradicate the crypto-craze that's been sweeping the nation for some time. One report suggests that instead of the government there are others seeking to license cryptocurrency exchanges. This would serve to further legitimise the industry, as well as making the environment safer for investors..

Meanwhile, Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors believes that the price per BTC should exceed the previous all-time high by July of this year. The longtime Bitcoin advocate noted in a report earlier today that during "bull" periods of upward trends, Bitcoin recoveries take 1.7 times the amount of time the initial decline lasted for. For Lee, this "implies that 85 days are needed to recover prior highs -- this is July 2018." His end of 2018 price call remains $25,000..

Bitcoin bulls arguing that the popular cryptocurrency could surpass gold as a flight to safety investment have gotten some discouraging market feedback in the past several weeks. When the S&P 500 experienced its largest sell-off in years this month, it coincided with bitcoin's lowest price dip in months, indicating investors don't yet see cryptocurrency as a safe way to preserve value..

The numbers suggest that the GBTC bitcoin fund does have a relatively low 0.07 correlation with the SPY ETF. In fact, the GBTC ETF has even less of a correlation to stocks than the GLD ETF, which has a negative 0.19 correlation. The negative correlation likely comes in part by the fact that investors tend to buy gold on days of market weakness..

In that same period, the ATR of the GLD as a percentage of its share price has been a relatively stable 0.8 percent. The ATR of the GBTC as a percentage of its share price, however, has been an incredibly volatile 14.2 percent..

With a volatility that high, investors simply can't feel safe in bitcoin-related investments in the near-term, even if the cryptocurrency has near zero correlation with stock prices. For now, bitcoin traders can feel good knowing that the stock market doesn't appear to be influencing bitcoin prices in any major way. But stock investors will likely stick to the relative stability of gold and other traditional safe-haven plays until the cryptocurrency market settles down..

Still, don't expect a mass surge of merchants gearing up to accept cryptocurrency.

Ripple prices have come full circle with the broad based rally in cryptocurrencies this week paring the early-February losses. The advance takes prices into monthly open resistance and while prices may be vulnerable here near-term the broader outlook remains constructive..

Technical Outlook: Ripple prices are up over 100% off the February lows with the advance now testing monthly open resistance at 1.1407. An ascending pitchfork formation extending off the January lows keeps the focus higher while above near-term support at ~9646 where the 100-day moving average converges on the 50-line. Broader bullish invalidation remains steady at the 2018 low-day close at 7600..

Notes: A closer look at Ripple price action sees the cryptocurrency breaking above basic trendline resistance extending off the record highs late-last week with a pullback and defense of this slope further validating the near-term breakout. Interim resistance targets eyed at 1.2203 backed by the median-line / 61.8% extension at 1.2956 - a breach there would be needed to fuel the next leg higher in price with such a scenario targeting subsequent resistance objectives at 1.5457 backed closely by 1.6177..

Bottom line: The immediate advance looks a bit vulnerable here but the broader focus remains weighted to the topside while above the monthly / yearly low-day close. From a trading standpoint, I'll favor fading weakness into structural support OR buying a break and retest of the median-line (1.2956) as support for a move back towards the 1.6177..

The firm recorded a record high of 226 global hedge funds with such a strategy, up from 110 global hedge funds as of Oct. 18. That itself was up from 55 funds at Aug. 29 and just 37 at the start of 2017..

The surge in funds comes at a volatile time for the cryptocurrencies they trade in. After hitting a record high close to $20,000 in December, bitcoin lost 70 percent of its value to slip below $6,000 in January, posting its worst monthly performance in three years..

Rival cryptocurrencies have also seen sharp declines.

The financial services provider Western Union (WU) is testing transactions with the use of Ripple's (XRP) Blockchain-based settlement system, the company's Chief Financial Officer Raj Agrawal said in an interview with Bloomberg Feb. 14..

The globally known money transfer company Western Union confirmed that it is testing Ripple following more than a month of rumor-fuelled speculation that began in early January. The announcement comes after Western Union reported its 2017 results, claiming a revenue of $1.4 bln - a 5 percent increase over the previous year..

As Ripple's CEO Brad Garlinghouse told Bloomberg, WU has decided to look into their platform in order to facilitate money transfers, particularly cross-border ones. Garlinghouse explained their choice by claiming that Ripple allows for transactions that are "a thousand times faster and a thousand times cheaper than Bitcoin's.".

Ripple (XRP) is a Blockchain-based settlement protocol and a cryptocurrency that has reached almost half of Bitcoin's market capitalization in early January 2018, when its price rallied to over $3.00 per coin. By the middle of January, however, the XRP price has bounced back to a little over $1.00..

So-called bitcoin miners are vital to keeping the underlying blockchain, or distributed ledger, network tick. A blockchain network is essentially a huge decentralized database that maintains a continuously growing record of transactions or other data. Miners solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain..

More impressive is that ETFs now deliver active management for nearly the same price as passive investing. The asset-weighted average expense ratio for passive ETFs -- those that track a market capitalization-weighted index -- is 0.21 percent. By comparison, the average expense ratio of smart beta ETFs -- those that replicate traditional styles of active management such as value, quality and momentum -- is 0.26 percent..

ETFs aspire to more than just low fees, however. The industry is also about democratizing investing -- bringing investing styles to ordinary investors that have traditionally been available only to institutional and high-net-worth investors -- and nurturing new ideas. It's no accident that smart beta and hedge fund replication, for example, have found homes in the ETF space, or that many of the proposed cryptocurrency funds are looking to launch as ETFs..

ZeroEdge.bet offers 0% edge Casino games. World first 0% edge games attract demand for Zerocoin, because of this, its value rises. Players can play 0% games while Zerocoin price rises. Simply put, the ultimate solution to the problem is creating a platform where playing games is "free". Players are not required to pay any fixed amount of money to be able to play at the casino. This can only be achieved by creating a closed loop economy with its own token where players purchase the token with fiat or crypto. Since the supply of ZERO is limited, its value is directly proportional to demand..

Ripple is being traded as a cryptocurrency, but it is more of a token than digital money. It peaked at $3.31 in January, but is trading at around $1.15 this week. The idea of the token is to act as a bridge between international bank transactions, not to become an alternative for fiat currencies. The majority of ripple tokens are held by the parent company, meaning that it can regulate their price..

Bitcoin is up 3.6% against the dollar to $9,825.91 at 7.55 a.m. GMT (2.55 a.m. ET). As the chart at the top shows, bitcoin slumped at the start of February but has been picking up again over the last week or so. It still remains far off its all-time highs of over $19,000 reached just before Christmas..

San Francisco-based Ripple has not had the best of starts to 2018. Its cryptocurrency, XRP, has been on a downward slide since the first week of January and has lost almost 70% of its value. However, things could be about to turn around for the company as Western Union is now test driving its transfer technology..

The list of banks and financial institutions that are using and testing Ripple's products is growing by the week. Fortune has reported that global payments giant Western Union can be added to that list this week. CFO Raj Agrawal told media that efforts were in a 'testing phase' and there was nothing so far in the process that would be a 'big unlock.'.

Regardless, it is still a huge boost for the blockchain company that has seen the price of its cryptocurrency plummet in recent months. On Tuesday, CEO Hikmet Ersek told analysts that Western Union is experimenting with Ripple and XRP for settling transactions and for capital optimization. The move comes a month after Ripple's dealings with rival company Moneygram, which was also testing XRP transfers..

Ripple has made more progress with partners than any other cryptocurrency.

The Asian arm of the company, SBI Ripple Asia, has made a lot of headway with Japanese and South Korean banks in adopting blockchain solutions for money transfers..

It's been a volatile start of the year for Bitcoin with the cryptocurrency plummeting a staggering 70% off the record highs set in December before rebounding sharply last week. The recovery is now approaching initial resistance and our focus over the next few days will be on breakout of the February opening range..

Technical Outlook: Bitcoin prices rebounded sharply early in the month off the 76.4% retracement of the July advance at 6039 with the rebound attempting to breach above confluence resistance today at 9164. A close above this threshold would alleviate further downside pressure near-term with such a scenario targeting monthly open resistance at 10149 backed by the 12/22 swing low / 38.2% retracement at 11171..

Notes: A closer look at price action sees Bitcoin trading within the confines of a near-term ascending channel formation with interim confluence resistance eyed around 9557-9715. The immediate advance may be vulnerable heading into this region near-term, but the focus remains higher for now while above 8337..

Near-term bullish invalidation rests at 8135 with a break there shifting the focus back towards the monthly lows. Bottom line: the focus remains higher near-term while above 8135 with a breach above a 9715 needed to fuel the next leg higher in price. From a trading standpoint, I'm looking higher near-term with the rally to ultimately offer better short-entries higher up near 10990-11171..

This ban still holds for those individuals who possess the Bankwest credit cards. Payments from the cryptocurrency exchanges to the credit cards, however, are going to be processed..

Clients of these two institutions will still continue using the debit cards or their transaction accounts in order to purchase cryptocurrencies..

CommBank comes out to explain why they made such a decision with the simple fact that cryptocurrencies in most cases are unregulated as well as being highly volatile in nature. We opted to make this choice since we have a strong belief that virtual currencies in most cases do not meet the minimum standard for regulation, reliability as well as reputation as compared to the currencies which we provide our customers with. Due to the dynamic and volatile nature of the virtual currency markets, its position is reviewed more often, the bank stated..

CommBank becomes the first bank in Australia to put a ban on its credit card owners from purchasing cryptocurrencies; however, it isn't the first bank to do so in the whole world. It was just last week when three major banks in the United States Citi, the Bank of America & J.P. Morgan Chase did announce the same measures. The United Kingdom's Lloyds Banking Group & Virgin Money did the same thing also..

The reasons behind these decisions were the same: high price, volatile nature of cryptocurrencies & the risk of the customers getting trapped into very serious debt. Several other banks have actually blocked the purchases of credit card cryptocurrency, in most cases to get rid of any possibilities of their clients piling up the cryptocurrency debt that goes unpaid when the market crashes..

I generally stay quiet on the cryptocurrency and Bitcoin front, not because I hold any strong position in either (I own zero cryptocurrency) but because I think it's a stupid, feverish fad that is only encouraged by allowing it any kind of oxygen whatsoever. But the fever doesn't appear to be abating, and meanwhile GPUs used for cryptocurrency mining are high demand, meaning they can't be used for other purposes for which they're well suited, including parsing data gathered by observatories to help find signs of extraterrestrial life..

Bitcoin was trading at $8,844 in India today on CoinDesks's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) at the time of reporting. The highest price of Bitcoin for today was recorded at $8,897.81. On Tuesday, Bitcoin's highest price was $8, 915.26. Still, the popular digital currency that was the flavor of the season for the most part of the last year is a long way from touching its high of $19,783 that it touched on December 17 last year. As per various cryptocurrency experts worldwide, Bitcoin will take good amount of time to recover the record highs that it touched in the second half of the last year. Earlier today, Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), said bringing about regulation of Bitcoin is not the job of his organisation. He was answering the questions about whether ECB will ban Bitcoins or regulate them in any way. "I have to say it's not the ECB's responsibility to do that," he announced..

Already slashed by more than half since hitting a record near $20,000 in December, the cryptocurrency could plunge a further 90 percent in an environment of unsustainably growing supply, according to Bloomberg Intelligence commodity strategist Mike McGlone. Using Amazon.com Inc. and the Nasdaq Composite Index's spectacular rise and retreat at the turn of the millennium as a proxy, he said the currency could plunge to $900..

While the creators of Bitcoin intended to limit supply to 21 million coins, forks mean that there are already more than 50 million outstanding coins based on the original blockchain. There's also nothing preventing rivals from spawning an infinite amount of clones, he said. The number of tradable cryptocurrencies jumped 120 percent in the past year..

"Parabolically increasing supply is the primary limitation to cryptocurrency market-price appreciation," McGlone said. "There's strong gravitational pull toward $900, the average price since inception and the start of 2017.".

FRANKFURT, Feb 13 (Reuters) - It is not the European Central Bank's job to regulate Bitcoin, its President Mario Draghi said on Tuesday, while warning the public about the risks associated with the volatile cryptocurrency..

Featuring a strong lineup of industry experts including Jesse Powell, founder and CEO of Kraken Bitcoin Exchange; Kian Lon Wong, president of NEM.io; Nick Spanos, founder and CEO of Blockchain Technologies Corporation; and Lawrence Wintermeyer, co-founder and principal of Elipses, the panel explored the context of cryptocurrencies and suggested possible scenarios for augmenting their use in the near future..

Powell initiated the dialogue by addressing the recent surge in the interest around cryptocurrencies. "Positive regulatory outcomes and the media have been key influencers for the increase in the use of cryptocurrencies over last year. Any time you have a massive surge in price, inevitably there is higher media attention. We also saw more retail and institutional investors enter the space..

"When the prices rise, more people get interested and try to find out what they are," added Spanos. "What cryptocurrencies are doing is establishing a certain peer-to-peer trust that did not exist before. People are enamoured by the technology and have started purchasing it.".

Spanos also rebuked criticisms that cryptocurrencies have received from seasoned global investors. He said: "Cryptocurrency is the people's currency of monetary independence, it is much more than a financial currency. Bitcoin is not a bubble, it is the pin that is popping the bubble of the legacy financial systems since it has been created.".

Bitcoin mining is becoming more expensive, according to JPMorgan..

Miners are the folks who unleash new bitcoin into the universe by running computationally intensive algorithms on systems called rigs. The miners pumping out the most computing power -- or "hash rate," referring to how many cryptographic calculations the machines can do per second -- have the best chance of earning a new bitcoin. As such, miners are building more and more rigs to one-up their competition..

That doesn't mean more bitcoin are being created. The coin's network is designed to increase the difficulty of successfully mining a coin as the total hash power increases in order to maintain a more or less steady rate of bitcoin creation. More hash power means higher energy costs. As such, the cost to mine one bitcoin has increased dramatically..

Bitcoin is one of the most popular digital currencies in the world and while it's a long way from completely replacing the real currencies we've known forever, it's now accepted in a lot more places than it was just a few years ago. Could you use bitcoin to pay your taxes? Lawmakers in Arizona are debating that very question and might end up allowing residents to pay their taxes in bitcoin..

The state Senate passed a bill on February 8th, if Senate Bill 1091 turns into law it would allow people to pay their taxes in cryptocurrency. The state's House of Representatives is now gearing up to debate this bill and it can't be said for sure right now if it's going to be passed..

If the bill becomes law, it will enable residents of Arizona to settle their tax payments through "a payment gateway, such as Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency, using electronic peer-to-peer systems.".

If Arizona does allow this, what would it do with all of the bitcoin it ends up with? "The Department shall convert cryptocurrency payments to United States Dollars at the prevailing rate within twenty-four hours after receipt and shall credit the taxpayer's account with the converted dollar amount," the bill explains..

The goal of the new currency is to increase the "block speed" at which the network can process transactions.

Litecoin, which was designed to be less energy intensive than bitcoin, saw an astronomical rise in 2017. The cryptocurrency skyrocketed from just $3.73 a year ago, to as high as $365 in December, leading founder Charlie Lee to warn investors about the possibility of losing everything. He also sold his entire stake after being accused of price manipulation..

Forks aren't uncommon in the cryptocurrency world, although they are not without controversy. Bitcoin cash famously split from the flagship bitcoin in August 2017, but the forked cryptocurrency has been accused of merely riding the coattails of the more established bitcoin..

The system only allows exchanges that have applied for a license, known as a "Bitlicense," from New York State's Department of Financial Services to trade cryptocurrencies. The system imposes detailed reporting regulations and a minimum capital requirement, limiting the number of firms and currencies that qualify, according to Business Korea. Adopting such a system would help bring cryptocurrency trading into a more familiar institutional framework and help the government supervise a notoriously volatile market, the government says..

South Korea's new management-minded approach is a dramatic turnaround from its energetic regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges this past year, alarmed at a heated market that saw local prices of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies in South Korea trade for higher than international levels..

The government responded by established more restrictive measures in December last year to curb anonymous transactions and allow regulators more leeway to shutter virtual currency exchanges. The price of Bitcoin, the world's largest digital currency, dropped 12% last month, partly on fears that South Korea would ban trading outright..

But the recent decline in cryptocurrency prices since their feverish peak last year -- when Bitcoin, now hovering around $8,700, nearly touched $20,000 -- has convinced the government that safely regulated markets could be viable, according to Business Korea..

Additionally, banning cryptocurrencies outright would prevent South Koreans from investing in the revolutionary blockchain technology that sustains the virtual coin markets. Deputy Prime Minister Kim Do-yeon echoed the government's softening stance recently, suggesting that South Korea doesn't need to "get rid of or suppress digital currencies.".

"We know that there are countries with important economies within OPEC, many of them are closely linked to US economy and politics. Let's see how the proposal of President Maduro about the use of Petro will be accepted in the framework of OPEC.

One thing remains true: negative comments continue to blast forth from the mouths of traditional investor talking heads. They've got their cash in stores of money that have little to do with cryptocurrency, and they're not quite prepared enough to support Bitcoin or any other blockchain-based tech. As such, they'll no doubt continue to spread FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) until cryptocurrency prices start stabilizing in a way with which they're familiar..

The announcement was greeted with suspicion fueled by the company's recent moves. In January BitGrail halted all withdrawals and deposits of nano, as well as the lisk and cryptoforecast tokens. The exchange said it would introduce obligatory identity verification and anti-money laundering protocols for its clients, in spite of claiming that it doesn't work with governments or banks. Some users accused the exchange of planning a so-called "exit scam", prompting the price of nano to drop 20 percent at the time..

So has the cryptocurrency bottomed out?.
`_ `__ `__ `_____________ `_______ `____ 
BTC has a history of rallying to fresh record highs after the relative strength index (RSI) has bottomed out at, or below, 30.00 (oversold region). However the daily chart throws some doubt on that pattern today..

The situation today looks similar. The RSI has recovered sharply from below 30.00 and BTC is up close to 40 percent from lows below $6,000. So, going by the historical pattern, BTC should rise to fresh record highs above $20,000..

You may soon be able to make money by selling your own genetic data, thanks to a US-based startup that is offering a service to sequence a customer's genome. Customers can have their genome sequenced for under USD 1,000, which could then be sold to scientists or pharmaceutical manufacturers..

The graphics card shortage caused by demand from cryptominers is showing no signs of abating, but Nvidia says it is doing "everything we can" to increase supply. CEO Jensen Huang reiterated that it is retailers who are setting the current exorbitant prices of GPUs but confirmed the company is asking them to prioritize gamers over miners..

Nvidia's relationship with cryptomining is a complicated one. The company just reported record quarterly revenue of $2.91 billion, up 10 percent from the previous quarter, thanks partly to miners rushing to buy its GPUs, often in bulk quantities. Nvidia's executive vice president and chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said: "Strong demand in the cryptocurrency market exceeded our expectations.".

But the firm values its core market of gamers and understands how they tie into Nvidia's other products, such as its G-Sync monitors. Brand loyalty is another important factor -- something not usually associated with miners -- and it knows the mining craze is likely to slow down in the future..
`__ `__ `___ `_____ `__ `___ `_____ `_ `_____ `__ `__________ `__ `___ `__ `___ `_______ `____ `________ `___ `_ `__ `_____ `________ `____ `______ `_ `______ `________ `_____ `_ `________ `__ `______ `_________ `___ `_____ `_ `__ `_ `____ `__ `_____ `____ `_ `_____ `_ `___ `___ `_ `__ `_______ 
Nvidia said it expected the situation to remain the same over the coming quarter but reaffirmed its commitment to gamers. "Our main focus remains on our core market, as cryptocurrency will likely remain volatile," added Kress..

Exactly how Nvidia plans to prioritize gamers wasn't made clear. Its request that retailers limit the maximum number of GPUs they sell to each miner isn't something the company can enforce. Hopefully, more sellers will follow in the footsteps of Micro Center and reduce the price of cards that are sold for gaming purposes..

"We're working really hard to get GPUs out into the marketplace for the gamers. We're doing everything we can, but I think the most important thing is, we just got to catch up with supply," said Huang on an earnings call..

Bitcoin clawed its way back from the four-month low of $5,922 it touched on Tuesday, rebounding 53 percent to $9,069. The S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both fell more than 5 percent this week, wiping out gains for the year. Emerging markets stocks and currencies also plunged, while shorter maturity U.S. Treasuries climbed as investors fled from risky assets to safe-havens..

Bitcoin's supporters are quick to extol the cryptocurrency' virtues as an asset that's uncorrelated to the broader market -- independent from any single country, company or central bank -- which can serve as a haven in times of market turmoil. And while that turmoil can usually be found in Bitcoin prices and headlines, this week U.S. equities are beating the largest cryptocurrency on that field..

The 70 percent slump from Bitcoin's high of almost $20,000 has prompted finance heavy weights to say the crypto bubble had finally popped. Judging from price action this week at least, maybe those calls were premature..

It was announced yesterday that BitGrail, the Italian cryptocurrency exchange, lost 17 million of the cryptocurrency NANO (XRB). To date, the hack is worth over $170 million USD..

A week ago, RaiBlocks rebranded to Nano and jumped in price nearly 40% in 24 just hours.The rebranding was highly anticipated by most in the project's community but not all were certain it would be the best move. Non-the-less, it seemed to have been a positive move until now..

BitGrail's primary purpose was to act as an exchange that facilitates the trading of the digital currency XRB. This exchange has been offline for a few weeks, and many had feared the worst. Today, the exchange's main operator confirmed the devastating news. "Francesco The Bomber," Firano said that the developers on the BitGlass and Nano project were unwilling to collaborate and BitGrail is unable to give the digital tokens back 100% to the coin users..

The Nano team developers responded to the issue via a Medium post:.
`__ `___ `___ `_________ `________ `_ `__ `____ `__ ` `_____ `_____ 
"From our own preliminary investigation, no double spending was detected on the ledger, and we have no reason to believe the loss was due to an issue in the Nano protocol. The problems appear to be related to BitGrail's software,".

In a CNBC interview on Feb. 7, 2018, the cryptocurrency billionaire said Bitcoin is still a "very underappreciated asset." He didn't give a time frame, but he said Bitcoin prices could be worth up to 40 times more than what Bitcoin prices were trading for on Feb. 7..

NEW YORK : Bitcoin and other digital currencies have, so far, not been formidable competition for cash, checks or credit cards as a payment method in the United States and other major economies, according to two economists at New York Federal Reserve..

For example, in 2015, as Greece struggled with its debt problem, Greek interest and trading in bitcoin jumped amid worries over capital controls and a possible exit from the euro zone, the New York Fed economists, Michael Lee and Antoine Martin said..

"Cryptocurrencies arguably solve the problem of making payments in a trust-less environment, but it is not obvious that this is a problem that needs solving, at least in the United States and other advanced economies," the post said..

Indeed, bitcoin, ethereum, ripple and other digital currencies, while they have grown in use and popularity, have notable drawbacks, the economists said..
`______ `_______ `________ 1_____ `__ `____ `______ `__________ `____ `___ `___ `____ `_ `__ `__ `__________ `___ `______ `_________ `__ `_________ `_____ 
With bitcoin, extreme volatility tends to undermine its function of storing value. This is unlike a traditional currency that is managed by a central bank, they said. Bitcoin transactions also consume a lot of electricity and it takes time to validate transactions, the economists said..

Although he became interested in bitcoin when it was at $70, Wozniak was put off by the cumbersome process for investing in bitcoin. Instead, he bought into bitcoin when it was at $700 price levels. Considering current price levels, he must have made a tidy profit during the sale..

`______ `___ `_ `_____ 1______ `_ `_ `__________ `__ `_ `_____ `__ `_____________ `______ `_ `__ `__ `___ `_ `____ `____ `__ `______ `____ `__________ 
"When it shot up high, I said, 'I don't want to become one of those people that watches it, watches it, and cares about the number,'" Woz said. "I don't want that kind of care in my life. Part of my happiness is not to have worries, so I sold it all -- just got rid of it -- except just enough to still experiment with.".

At the Money 20/20 conference in October 2017, Wozniak said bitcoin is better than gold or the U.S. dollar because it had a finite supply. According to him, gold's finite supply could be increased, if humans came up with a more efficient way to mine it. Similarly, the supply of U.S. dollars could be controlled (i.e., increased or decreased) for political reasons by a governing authority..

But bitcoin's supply was mathematically constrained to 21 million. "Gold gets mined and mined and mined," he said. "Maybe there's a finite amount of gold in the world, but bitcoin is even more mathematical and regulated and nobody can change mathematics.".

Wozniak assessed bitcoin as a store of value back then and compared it to owning a house. "Your house has value. And it is a house today, 40 years from now, it still is a house in value," he said. At the Nordic Business Forum, he said he expected bitcoin to become a medium of transaction next..

Bitcoin has come a long way from its $700 price levels. The cryptocurrency almost touched $20,000 in December 2017 on the back of online chatter and media mentions. Since the start of this year, however, it has been in a prolonged swoon and has lost almost half of its value. (See also: Bitcoin Price Continues Plunge As Congressional Hearings Loom.).

What's supposed to be the most volatile asset in the universe is proving to be a bastion of stability compared with wild swings and carnage in global equities this week..

Bitcoin is clawing its way back from the four-month low of $5,922 it touched on Tuesday, rebounding 47 percent to $8,650. The S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are both down more than 6 percent this week, wiping out gains for the year. Emerging markets stocks and currencies also plunged, while U.S. Treasuries climbed as investors fled from risky assets to safe-havens..

Bitcoin's supporters are quick to extol the cryptocurrency' virtues as an asset that's uncorrelated to the broader market -- independent from any single country, company or central bank -- which can serve as a haven in times of market turmoil. And while that turmoil can usually be found in Bitcoin prices and headlines, this week U.S. equities are beating the largest cryptocurrency on that field..

Since the drop below $6,000, Bitcoin has been on a steady climb, causing volatility measures on the digital asset to stabilize while the sell-off in the S&P 500 triggered the biggest jump on the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index ever..

The 70 percent slump from Bitcoin's high of almost $20,000 has prompted finance heavy weights to say the crypto bubble had finally popped. Judging from price action this week at least, maybe those calls were premature..

Centra aims to bridge the gap between crypto and fiat currencies and make purchasing with a range of cryptocurrencies as easily available as paying with a credit card. The foundation of their ecosystem is a smart wallet for storing multiple cryptocurrencies, and a card that allows you to spend those cryptocurrencies anywhere in the world where they accept MasterCard..

This gives cardholders access to over 36 million points of sale around the world. The conversion into fiat currencies is done by the proprietary Currency Conversion Engine (CCE), avoiding most exchange fees and credit card handling charges..

They have also developed a coin (CTR), which acts as the gas and utility currency of the Centra ecosystem, and the foundation for the pre-paid cards. You need to freeze a set amount of CTR in your smart wallet to be issued a card of a certain colour. The colour of the card is what determines your purchasing limit. There are three cards available:.

Nvidia reported a record fourth-quarter on Thursday, and shares are trading up more than 10% in early trading..
`_____ `_______ ` `_____ `_____________ `_ `________ `__ `_____ `__ `______ `_ `___ `___ `__ `_ `____ `________ 
Wall Street was largely expecting the company to beat on earnings, but was worried good numbers would rely on unreliable and volatile cryptocurrency demand. Nvidia's earnings show it's more than just a crypto company though, soothing those investors fears..
`___ `_____ `__ `______ `________ `__ `______ `_ `___ `_ `________ `__ `__ `______ `___ `______ `____ `___ `_ `_________ `__ `_______ `_____________ `______ `_______ `_______ `___ `___ `___ `___ `___ ` `_____ `______ `______ `_______ `____ `________ `______ 
"1) Data Center growth of 20% or more? (Check, 21.0%); 2) Gaming growth of 5-6% or more? (Check, 11.4%); 3) Gross margins in the 60s? (Check, 62.1%) and 4) Guidance of down 1-3% sequentially? (Check, flat at mid-point with margin expansion)," Mitch Steves, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets said in a note to clients Friday..
`__ `___ `_____ `_____ `_ `__ `_ `____ `______ `______ `_ `_____ `_____ `_ `___ `_ `____ `______ `______ `_ `____ `______ `_ `__ `___ `______ `_____ `__ `_ `_______ `_ `___ `___ `____________ `______ `___ `_ `________ `___ `_____ `___________ `____ `______ `_ `______ `_ `__ `______ `______ `___ `_ ` `___ `_ `______ `_______ 
Ahead of the report, some analysts were worried Nvidia would have trouble showing it could sustain growth outside of its graphics division. Cryptocurrency miners contributed about $70 million in sales during the third quarter, and Steves estimates the miners added about $180 million in sales during the fourth quarter..
`____ `_ `__ `______ `___ `_______ `___ `______ `_____ `____ `___ `______ `______ `_ `____ `______ `_____ `______ `_ `__ `_______ `________ `_____________ `_____ `__________ `____ `__ `______ `_ `____ `_____ `__ `____ `_______ `__ `_____ `________ `__ `_____ `____ `____ `___ `______ `_ `____ `_____ `__ `_____ `________ 
AMD, Nvidia's main rival in the space, said about one-third of its graphics division growth came from cryptocurrency miners, which led some investors to worry if the company would be growing without the wildly volatile cryptocurrency market. After it's earnings report, it looks like Nvidia isn't facing the same problems..

The one blip in Nvidia's stellar report came from the sluggish growth in its automotive division. Nvidia's chips for power infotainment systems and self-driving cars are off to a slow start, but the company could just be a bit too far ahead of the curve, Steves said. In a couple years, when autonomous cars become more popular and more advanced, the 3% growth will start to be a bigger problem..

Steves rates Nvidia as an "outperform" and has a $280 price target, about 22% higher than the current price..

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) reported a strong earnings beat, but wasn't strong enough for at least one analyst to turn bullish on the stock..

KeyBanc Capital Markets' Michael McConnell maintains a Sector Weight rating on Nvidia's stock with no assigned price target..
`______ `______ `_______ `______ `________ `________ ` `_____ `_____ `_____ `_ `_______ `____ `___ `_ `_______ `____ `_______ 
Nvidia's fourth quarter report consisted of a revenue beat on strong sales of GPUs to the datacenter end market, the gaming end market, and for use in cryptocurrency mining, McConnell said in a note. Gross margin of 61.9 percent came in ahead of the 59.7 percent the analyst expected due to a favorable mix of higher-margin datacenter segment sales, while a lower-than-expected tax rate also helped the company report an earnings beat..
`_______ `_____ `______ `_____ `________ `_ ` `______ `___ `_ `_____ `____ `_ `___ `_ `__ `_________ `__ `______ `__ `_____ `__ `______ `__ `__ `__ `_ `_____________ `______ `________ `___ `_ ` `____ `____ `_____ `_ `___ `______ `___ `_ `____ `_ `__ `___ `______ `__ `______ `_______ `__ `_ ` `________ `__ `_ `____________ `_________ `______ `_____ `____ ` `__________________ `__ `___ `___ `_____ `__ `______ `_____ `_ `_______ `_____ 
Nvidia's report offset the analyst's prior concerns on growth in the gaming segment, but the company's guidance came in flat. Management guided its first quarter revenue to be $2.9 billion, which implies zero growth from the fourth quarter but 50 percent year-over-year..

Nvidia's valuation needs to be taken into consideration. The analyst's fair value for Nvidia's stock at $206 is based on a 25 times multiple on his new fiscal 2020 earnings per share estimate of $8.25 and implies the stock has downside potential. A bull-case scenario would value the stock at $265, while a bear-case scenario would see the stock valued at $191..

The 100 SMA is still below the longer-term 200 SMA to indicate that the path of least resistance is to the downside. This means that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse..

Stochastic is turning slightly higher to signal that buyers are returning, but RSI is still on its way south so bitcoin price might follow suit. If the $8,000 level holds as support, price could bounce up to the swing high or the channel resistance closer to $9,000..

For bitcoin price, it seems that traders are mostly waiting for a strong catalyst that could encourage investors to reopen their long positions. One possible factor could be the Senate hearing that called upon regulators to increase oversight without hampering development, something that could still be overall positive for the cryptocurrency industry..

NVIDIA is not blind to the current GPU shortage. During an investors conference call, Jen-Hsun Huang, CEO of NVIDIA made it clear that the company is doing its level best to address the shortage, and that its focus is still set on the gamers and not the miners..

NVIDIA disclosed that during the fourth quarter earnings of its 2018 fiscal year, its GPU business brought in a record revenue of US$2.46 billion (~RM9.69 billion), exceeding its initial expectations. The company, however, did hint that it was the strong GPU demand in the cryptocurrency market that contributed to this boom in revenue..

To recap, PC gamers have essentially been left in the lurch looking for an affordable GPU, and it's mainly due to cryptocurrency miners snagging up every available GPU they can get their hands on..

To make matters worse, there is also a global shortage of memory chips, which in turn has affected the production supply of graphics cards. In light of the shortage, many retailers have increased the price of all graphics cards model. Again, this has left many gamers frustrated, simply because they aren't willing to pay more than what a card is worth..

For example, a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti from any brand currently sells for RM4,000 on average, while a mid-range GPU such as the GeForce GTX 1060 and Radeon RX 480 can be purchased for an average price of RM2,000..

Despite their rough entry to 2018, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are here to stay according to cyber security expert-cum-Shark Tank investor, Robert Herjavec. The 55-year-old Croatian-Canadian entrepreneur feels that digital currency is a logical replacement for the paper cash that we as a society are increasingly less dependent upon. Speaking with Time's MONEY show, the TV investor stated:.

He's also particularly optimistic about blockchain technology. For him, the backbone of digital currencies could be a real game changer to the cyber security industry he's so familiar with. He believes that decentralised data storage solutions will revolutionise the verification of business transactions:.

However, Herjavec isn't completely sold just yet. The investor hasn't used any of the $200 million he has behind him to take a position in any cryptocurrency just yet. He still feels its too much like the Wild West at present. He told the news outlet:.

"There's no base for it... When I buy a house and it's overpriced, I can live in it. There's some fundamental value. The challenge with cryptocurrency is, it could go to zero. There's no one exchange that is making them. Exchanges that sell them now can be hacked. We recently saw the largest breach ever -- $500 million in 24 hours. If you had bought that exchange, it's not that you've gone down 20% or 40%, you've actually gone to zero.".

Today's sentiment from the businessman and investor seems to mirror that expressed to BNN last December. On Bitcoin's insane price run out at the tail end of last year, the Shark Tank personality stated:.

He went on to display a somewhat dated and naive interpretation of the cryptocurrency economy as it exists at present:.

Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is hovering just above the $7,000 mark per coin as the digital currency market suffers one of its most widely covered and harshest sell-offs in recent history. In December, the bitcoin frenzy hit its peak with the cryptocurrency flying to record highs near the $20,000 mark. While investors may be extremely unsettled as bitcoin trades at less than half of its value of a month ago, one early crypto investor suggests that volatility is normal and that the market will stabilize this year after bitcoin regains its value.

"We've seen it go down 50% at a time. It's quite a resilient currency/commodity/asset that just keeps going up afterwards," said Ran Neu-Ner, host of CNBC's "Cryptotrader." "I think 2018 is the year where the mechanisms to allow retail consumers to get into cryptocurrencies start to open themselves up ... The price will become more stable.".

Last week, Neu-Nur predicted bitcoin bottoming around $7,500, indicating that he couldn't see it going much under that due the big uptake in crypto trading, particularly highlighting "a lot of retail money that has gone into bitcoin." A day after his interview on CNBC, the investor "pinned a tweet" forecasting bitcoin to finish this year at $50,000..

Neu-Nur made his bull case based on the idea that in 2018, "the mechanisms to allow retail consumers to get into cryptocurrencies start to open up." For example, he noted that Robinhood, a popular online brokerage used primarily by Millennials, started offering free bitcoin trading last week. As it becomes easier for the retail investor to start trading bitcoin, Neu-Nur expects the price of the digital currency to stabilize. He attributes bitcoin's large price swings to a market with "not enough buyers and not enough sellers.".

The investor also recommended buying ethereum, indicating that "the smartest people in the world are developing on ethereum." While bitcoin has two use cases at max, either serving as a currency or a store of value, Neur-Nur said that ethereum is attractive as a platform for multiple uses, from hedging to betting and sports..
