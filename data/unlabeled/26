That compares to a rise of 1.1 per cent in the previous quarter.\n\nHowever, the figure marks the third consecutive quarter of growth as the supermarket endured three years of sales falls.\n\nDoug McMillon, president and chief executive of Walmart, said: 'In the U.K., Asda delivered positive comp sales again this quarter with particular strength during the Christmas period. [...] We know we have more work to do in the U.K., however we are encouraged by recent results in key areas of our business.'\n\n12:21 CBI reaction to survey: Demand strong and output growing 'briskly'\n\nAnna Leach, head of economic intelligence at the CBI, said:\n\n'This month saw another strong showing from UK manufacturers. Although order books weren't quite as buoyant as they were last month, demand remains strong and output grew briskly.\n\n'With the Brexit negotiations reaching a critical juncture, many businesses are concerned about future barriers to trade and are looking for clarity over the future relationship with the EU.\n\n'Remaining in a comprehensive customs union will help alleviate some of those fears and give firms the confidence to invest and grow.'\n\n12:13 CBI industrial trends survey: Good growth for industry\n\nOrders for manufacturers and exporters remained 'well above' the average in February according to a survey by the Confederation of British Industry.\n\nThe CBI's trends survey found output grew at a 'healthy pace' in the three months up to February this year and was mostly driven by food, drink and tobacco, as well as motor vehicle and transport equipment.\n\nCBI said total order books weakened across the sector, with a balance of 10% of firms reporting an increase in the three months to February, down from 14% in January, but still above the long-run averages.\n\nHowever, respondents to the survey said they expected output growth would slow over the next three months and the CBI itself predicted subdued growth in the economy more broadly in 2018.\n\n12:00 Maplin's future hangs in the balance\n\nThe jobs of 2,500 shop staff at the Maplin's electronics chain are hanging in the balance as the firm struggles to stay afloat.\n\nBosses are said to be desperately seeking cash to help save the British retailer before it collapses into administration.\n\nThey are talking to potential buyers and want to secure new investors before the end of this week, according to Sky News.\n\n11:15 Melrose acquisitions push up profits for takeover firm\n\nMelrose, the company at the heart of a hostile takeover bid for British engineering firm GKN, has released its results for 2017 claiming its acquisition of US-based Nortek made it a 'successful year' for the firm.\n\nIt has undergone Melrose's 'fastest transformation' to date and improved sales performance in the second half of the year.\n\n'As a result, the Melrose Group revenue for the year was \u00a32.09bn, up from \u00a3889m in 2016.'\n\nDespite declaring a statutory loss before tax of \u00a327.6 million, the underlying profit before tax was \u00a3257.7 million, up from \u00a396.4 million in 2016.\n\n10:42 Full story: HSBC results\n\nThe full story on HSBC's results is available to read here.\n\nIts share price is still down 3.8% this morning as investors focused on results missing analyst expectations rather than positive revenue growth.\n\n10:17 Delivery service shares steady despite KFC chicken crisis\n\nDespite causing more than 500 KFC fast food restaurants to shut when deliveries of chicken failed to show up - the owner of the delivery service responsible, DHL, has maintained its share price.\n\nDeutsche Post shares are currently 0.11% higher and have stayed largely flat overall since the chicken chaos kicked off over the weekend.\n\nIt is trading at 37.15.\n\n10:10 The impact of 'expectations' versus reality\n\n#HSBC share price fall provides a reminder that in the short term, actual results are usually less important than the comparison of results to 'expectations'. It is very difficult to make money this way. Better to focus on valuation and the long term drivers of profit growth. -- Dan Kemp (@Dan_the_analyst)\n\nFebruary 20, 2018\n\n10:09 FTSE continues slump\n\nIt started yesterday and the FTSE has continued its slow slump today - now down 0.5% at just over 7,200.\n\nIts lowest point during the global sell off a few week's ago was 7,092.\n\nIt has been dragged down by the struggling share prices of some big companies - HSBC, Intercontinental Hotels and BHP Billiton.\n\n09:57 Morning cryptocurrency update\n\nBitcoin has held onto its position above $11,000.\n\nCrypto update:#BITCOIN 11337.86 +2.31%#ETHER 935.54 -0.07%#BITCOINCASH 1496.70 -1.21%#RIPPLE 1.095 -1.26%#LITECOIN 239.24 +7.48%#BTC #ETH #BCH #XRP #LTC -- IGSquawk (@IGSquawk)\n\nFebruary 20, 2018\n\n09:44 'If China sneezes, HSBC is going to catch a nasty cold...'\n\nLaith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:\n\n'Rising interest rates and a thriving global economy have helped HSBC to post a healthy increase in profits in 2017. However the market was expecting more, and has consequently marked down the share price. That's not going to help the Footsie, given the gravitational pull HSBC exerts on the index.\n\n'Revenues have risen faster than costs across HSBC's three core businesses, and when you're as big as HSBC, that leaves you with some pretty big numbers in the bottom line. HSBC has stripped out $6.1 billion of annual costs since 2015, that's the size of a big FTSE 250 company.\n\n'HSBC has definitely pinned its flag to the Asian mast, with over three quarters of profits now coming from the far east. The long term appeal of this approach is clear, with the Asian middle class set to balloon by a staggering 2 billion people by 2050.\n\n'However this approach comes with risks attached. The strength of HSBC's share price over the last two years has a lot to do with better than expected economic performance from China. That's all well and good, but this cuts both ways, and looking forward if China sneezes, HSBC is going to catch a nasty cold.'\n\n09:05 BHP Bilton joins the FTSE fallers\n\nHigher commodity prices saw BHP's revenues climb 16% in the first half to $21.8bn, with operating expenses up 15% to $15.4bn.\n\nBut its share price fell 2.5% this morning, despite improving revenues leading to a 25% jump in profits.\n\nThe group announced an interim dividend of $0.55 per share, up 38% on the previous year and $0.17 above the 50% of earnings target.\n\nNicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, explained the share price fall.\n\n'Investors were expecting more. BHP's better performance is being driven by improved commodity prices, which are out of the company's hands, while productivity, which it can control, is heading in the wrong direction,' he said.\n\n08:50 Owner of Holiday Inn suffers in trading\n\nShares in the Intercontinental Hotel Group - the owner of the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza hotels - have fallen more than 4% this morning despite profits and revenue at the firm rising.\n\nThe announcement of a strategic review to save $125m for 'reinvestment to drive growth' appears to have spooked investors.\n\nThe firm said today: 'To ensure we continue to outperform, we are today announcing a series of strategic initiatives that will enable us to redirect resources and focus on areas where we can enhance our proven business model, to allow us to deliver industry leading net rooms growth.'\n\n08:43 Sports Direct launches \u00a3100m share buyback\n\nMike Ashley's Sports Direct has announced it is commencing a \u00a3100million share buyback programme over the next eight months.\n\nThe firm said a maximum of 30million shares could be purchased.\n\nSports Direct share price, which is down 5 per cent so far this year, was up 1.4 per cent at 362.56p this morning.\n\n08:39 Dunelm Group shares slump\n\nDunelm shares have slumped 13% after markets opened as margins 'took a battering'.\n\nIt comes amid turmoil for retailers struggling to keep their heads above water in a fast changing market with internet shopping and a fall in overall consumer sentiment.\n\nIt's tough out there for the homeware retailers.\n\n08:25 After opening up, FTSE down\n\nIn a mirror image of its performance yesterday, the FTSE 100 has fallen into the red after first opening higher.\n\nIt has been hit by results from three big index big-hitters and has fallen two points on open.\n\nThe three FTSE companies reporting earnings today are the biggest market fallers: InterContinetal Hotels (-4.2%); BHP Billiton (-3%); and HSBC (-2.7%). -- Garry White (@GarryWhite)\n\nFebruary 20, 2018\n\n08:22 FTSE 250 financial services firm share price jumps\n\nFTSE 250 listed firm Fidessa Group has sent its share price shooting up 23% this morning after confirming it was in talks with software giant Temenos over a possible takeover.\n\nShares surged 690 points higher to 3,772.50 after an earlier boost yesterday which forced the group to confirm the news.\n\n08:17 Not all bad for HSBC\n\nHSBC may have fallen short of market expectations, but with revenues higher for the first time in six years there is much to take note of.\n\nNeil Wilson of ETX Capital says: 'There may be a bit of concern around costs that is impacting shares - adjusted operating expenses were 4% higher due to higher pay and investments in growth, up from the 3% reported six months ago. Nevertheless this appears to be the result of revenue growth and positive jaws of 1% suggest this doesn't look like much to worry about.'\n\nSome of the most interesting parts of the results aren't even in the finances, but in the six-page legal section.\n\n'A full six pages of the results release were dedicated to updates on litigation and legal proceedings, an overhang from past misdeeds that the bank is yet to entirely draw a line under.\n\n'Specific litigation costs vary and may be higher than provided for but the worst of this looks to be discounted by the market already,' Wilson adds.\n\n08:14 HSBC results fall short\n\nGlobal bank HSBC has reported a huge 11% jump in adjusted profits before tax for 2017 - with adjusted revenue up 5% to $51.5 billion.\n\nDespite the strong results the banking giant still fell far short of what market analysts had expected for the year, with its shares dipping during trading in Asia overnight.\n\nThe FTSE 100 listed company has opened 2.7% lower in the UK this morning.\n\nThe firm said its focus on Asian markets over the year had driven 75% of the profits.\n\nRecently appointed chairman Mark E Tucker said: 'Our 2017 results demonstrate both the strength and the potential of the Group.\n\n'A large increase in reported profit before tax reflected both a healthy business and the non-recurrence of significant items from 2016.\n\n'All of our global businesses grew adjusted profits and our three main global businesses generated improved adjusted revenue.'\n\n08:10 FTSE opens up\n\nThe FTSE 100 has opened higher this morning - up 0.01% so far to 7,248.03.\n\nIt struggled yesterday and closed the day down around 40 points.\n\n{\"id\":\"5411857\",\"channel\":\"/money\",\"pageUrl\":\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-5411857/FTSE-LIVE-HSBC-falls-short-despite-profit-boost.html\",\"status\":\"running\",\"greenBox\":{\"body\":\"\"},\"modifiedOrder\":1} 0 0"
