VApple MacBook ProCleaning cloth, Strength, lightness, beauty - seamlessly integratedMacBook Pro is machined from a single piece of aluminum, an engineering breakthrough that replaced many parts with just one. It's called the unibody. And the first time you pick up a MacBook Pro you'll notice the difference it makes. The entire enclosure is thinner and lighter than other notebooks. It looks polished and refined. And it feels strong and durable - perfect for life inside (and outside) your briefcase or backpack.FaceTime HD cameraThe FaceTime HD camera built into the MacBook Pro display is even thinner than the camera inside iPhone 4.A display full of bright ideasLED backlight technology for the MacBook Pro makes the display instantly bright and allows it to be incredibly thin. They used edge-to-edge glass not just because it looks beautiful, but because it lends structure to the display. And at the top of the screen they hid the built-in FaceTime HD camera. So you see your friends and family in big, beautiful widescreen - and as little of the camera as possible.Multi-touch trackpad - it just feels rightThe multi-touch trackpad has no button because it is the button. That means there's more room to track and more room to click - left, right, center, and everywhere in between. The result is a trackpad that just makes sense to you - and your fingers.Easy access to connections and portsThe connections and ports on MacBook Pro - Gigabit Ethernet, USB, and audio in/out - are all smartly integrated on the same side of the notebook. So your cables stay neatly organized, and connecting and disconnecting your devices is easy and convenient.Designed to make an impactComplete control over how the MacBook Pro is designed, how it's manufactured, and how it's packaged gives Apple an environmental edge. LED backlight technology preserves energy. Glass and aluminum are highly recyclable. MacBook Pro is free of most harmful toxins., Strength, lightness, beauty - seamlessly integratedFaceTime HD cameraA display full of bright ideasMulti-touch trackpad - it just feels rightEasy access to connections and portsDesigned to make an impact
