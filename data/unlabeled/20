"A South Korean official who oversaw his country's regulatory clampdown on cryptocurrencies was found dead on Sunday, officials have said.\n\nInvestigators say that Jung Ki-joon, 52, the head of economic policy at South Korea's Office for Government Policy Coordination, was initially thought to have suffered a heart attack but is now believed to have died from an unknown cause.\n\nJung oversaw moves to introduce new laws that were intended to eradicate cryptocurrency speculation and other illicit activity.\n\nJung Ki-joon (pictured) was initially thought to have suffered a heart attack but his cause of death remains unknown\n\nMr Jung recently insisted that virtual currencies like bitcoin were not a form of legal currency and the South Korean government would 'strongly respond' to excessive cryptocurrency speculation\n\nFILE - In this Friday, Dec. 8, 2017, file photo, a man uses a Bitcoin ATM in Hong Kong. In January this year the value of numerous forms of digital currency tumbled after South Korea, a hotbed for currencies like bitcoin, said it was considering a trading ban\n\nThe Yonhap state news agency said that that he had been under immense pressure over the last year in his job which involved co-ordinating the opinions of various ministries in relation to the regulation of cryptocurrencies.\n\nSouth Korea has been an international centre for cryptocurrency trading - but the possibility of new legislation has damaged on the price of bitcoin this year following dramatic rises in 2017.\n\nBitcoin traded at $20,000 in December - before global efforts to regulate cryptocurrencies gathered momentum - and is now trading at round $11,000, according to research site CoinDesk, representing a loss of about 70 percent of its value.\n\nThe volatility of cryptocurrency, combined with a widespread lack of understanding of the market, has led many financial experts to warn people to steer clear.\n\nAt a briefing last month, Mr Jung insisted that virtual currencies like bitcoin were not a form of legal currency and the government would 'strongly respond to excessive cryptocurrency speculation and illegal activity.'\n\nNearly 5 percent of all bitcoin transactions world-wide last year used the South Korean won, making it the most widely used fiat currency in bitcoin trading after the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen and the euro, according to CryptoCompare.\n\nThe South Korean won was also the second-most widely-used currency for trading some alternative cryptocurrencies, including ether and Bitcoin Cash, which is a bitcoin rival."
