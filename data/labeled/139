Vitalik Buterin warned on Twitter that cryptocurrencies 'could drop to near-zero at any time'. In the last few weeks, we have been witnessing a highly volatile cryptocurrency price. The Bitcoin price which was close to $20,000 in December has dropped as low as $6,000 at the start of the year only to climb back to $10,000 in recent days.. In the midst of the crypto-craze, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin warned on Twitter that cryptocurrencies 'could drop to near-zero at any time'. "Cryptocurrencies are still a new and hyper-volatile asset class and could drop to near-zero at any time," Buterin tweeted.. "Don't put in more money than you can afford to lose," the 24 -year old added.. "If you're trying to figure out where to store your life savings, traditional assets are still your safest bet," Buterin tweeted.. Canadian citizen Buterin, who is the son of Russian immigrants, started his work in the cryptocurrency space by writing on a bitcoin blog. In September 2011, he co-founded a new publication called Bitcoin Magazine, where he was the leading writer.. He continued working in Bitcoin Magazine till 2014. It was during this time he argued that bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development, which wasn't well received.. Following the disagreement with the Bitcoin community, Buterin developed a new platform with a more general scripting language leading to the creation of Ethereum..
