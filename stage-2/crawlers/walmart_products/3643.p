VApple MacBook ProCleaning cloth, power adapter, It makes quicker work of everythingWhen your goal is to build the high-performance notebook of the future, you begin at its foundation. For this MacBook Pro, that foundation was flash. Because when you build a notebook around an all-flash architecture, not only is everything more durable, reliable, and battery efficient - everything is fast. Really, really fast.Matching power for powerA long battery life is impressive for any notebook. But for a high-performance notebook with an ultra-high-resolution display, top-of-the-line processors and graphics, and a superslim design, it's absolutely remarkable. The built-in battery gives you up to 1000 full charge and discharge cycles. Which means you can put your MacBook Pro to sleep, and it'll come back on instantly - after a day, a week, or even a month.Advanced speaker designYou haven't heard it all until you've heard the speakers inside the MacBook Pro. For something so thin and light, the sound is huge. And with a wide dynamic range, optimal balance, and a crisp, expressive quality, these speakers might sound too good to be true. That's because they labored painstakingly over the design to maximize the quality of every decibel you hear.They'll hear you loud and clearDual built-in microphones are great for when you want to be heard. If you're making a FaceTime call, for example, the microphones reduce background noise from behind the notebook. And when you use dictation, they create an adaptive audio beam that intelligently adjusts to detect your voice - instead of the noise around you.A brighter way to workThin and light, this notebook is designed to go anywhere - including places with less-than-stellar lighting. A built-in sensor detects changes in ambient light and adjusts the keyboard brightness automatically. So you're never left in the dark., More color and contrast, less glareIt makes quicker work of everythingMatching power for powerAdvanced speaker designThey'll hear you loud and clearA brighter way to work
