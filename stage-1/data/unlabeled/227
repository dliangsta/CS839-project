"Atari is trying to make itself relevant in a new world filled with cryptocurrencies, so the company has unveiled two new cryptos: Atari Token and Pong Token.\n\nThe company has announced it has partnered with blockchain company Infinity Networks, where they will create tokens as part of an investment deal. First up, the Atari Token is for entertainment, with a press release detailing: \"The company is developing a decentralized platform giving access to any form of digital entertainment,that is to say a very wide offer ranging from video games to movies and music. This platform, under development, will operate using a cryptocurrency, the Atari Token\".\n\nPong Token is all about gaming, where it's explained as: \"The second project in progress is the strengthening of the partnership with Pariplay, Ltd in the launch in 2018 of casino platforms allowing players to bet either in real money or with most crypto-currencies currently outstanding. These casino sites will offer many Atari games. To broaden the appeal of these new casinos, and once the Atari Token available, Atari has the project to launch Pong Token, a second Token dedicated to crypto-casinos and usable on these gaming sites. The details of this launch of crypto-casinos will be announced soon\".\n\nAtari is playing it smart, and is getting around regulation - they're calling their cryptocurrency \"tokens\" and not \"coins\". Atari is so concerned with regulation, that they added: \"This press release is not to be published or distributed in the United States of America, Australia, Canada, Japan or Italy or any other jurisdiction in which the offering or sale of financial securities would be prohibited by law. in force.
