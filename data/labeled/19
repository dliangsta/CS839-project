February 20, 2018. 09:44 'If China sneezes, HSBC is going to catch a nasty cold...'. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:. 'Rising interest rates and a thriving global economy have helped HSBC to post a healthy increase in profits in 2017. However the market was expecting more, and has consequently marked down the share price. That's not going to help the Footsie, given the gravitational pull HSBC exerts on the index.. 'Revenues have risen faster than costs across HSBC's three core businesses, and when you're as big as HSBC, that leaves you with some pretty big numbers in the bottom line. HSBC has stripped out $6.1 billion of annual costs since 2015, that's the size of a big FTSE 250 company.. 'HSBC has definitely pinned its flag to the Asian mast, with over three quarters of profits now coming from the far east. The long term appeal of this approach is clear, with the Asian middle class set to balloon by a staggering 2 billion people by 2050.. 'However this approach comes with risks attached. The strength of HSBC's share price over the last two years has a lot to do with better than expected economic performance from China. That's all well and good, but this cuts both ways, and looking forward if China sneezes, HSBC is going to catch a nasty cold.'. 09:05 BHP Bilton joins the FTSE fallers.

HSBC may have fallen short of market expectations, but with revenues higher for the first time in six years there is much to take note of.. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital says: 'There may be a bit of concern around costs that is impacting shares - adjusted operating expenses were 4% higher due to higher pay and investments in growth, up from the 3% reported six months ago. Nevertheless this appears to be the result of revenue growth and positive jaws of 1% suggest this doesn't look like much to worry about.'. Some of the most interesting parts of the results aren't even in the finances, but in the six-page legal section.. 'A full six pages of the results release were dedicated to updates on litigation and legal proceedings, an overhang from past misdeeds that the bank is yet to entirely draw a line under..
