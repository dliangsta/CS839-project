The set I comes from the labeled set G (which is a sample of tuple pairs after the blocking step which we have labeled as matches or not matches).

I is the development set which we use to train and debug our learning-based classifiers, and the only set we can use to tweak our classifiers/feature vectors to improve our performance.

We split the feature vectors of I into U and V, where U was the set of development-train instances and V was the set of development-test instances.
