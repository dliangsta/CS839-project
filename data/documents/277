"Anyone thinking of investing in Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency should be very careful - their values are volatile, with the ability to plummet as quickly as they shoot up.\n\nCRYPTOCURRENCIES have become popular in recent months with investors trying their luck at making some cash.\n\nBut the online world is volatile and just as the value can soar, the market can crash extremely quickly, as more currencies emerge.\n\nDash is similar to Litecoin in that it was created to improve on the weakness of the bitcoin network.\n\nIt was first called XCoin, before becoming darkcoin.\n\nIt then merged into Dash - representing \"digital cash\".\n\nThe developers of this currency created the world's first self-funding and self-governed blockchain protocol.\n\nThis refers to a peer-to-peer cryptocurency that uses a two-tier network, rather than a single-tier.\n\nThis network is achieved through an incentive based system where 10 per cent of each block portion is allocated back to Dash developers who get payments for contributions.\n\nFeatures include something called \"InstantSend\" which is instantaneous in a transfer, and \"PrivateSend\" which keeps the user to be anonymous.\n\nIn mid January the price was hovering between $790 and $822.\n\nIn November, when it was less popular, the value was $260 a coin.\n\nIt appears that there are many sites online which offer to help people buy Dash.\n\nBut in all cases buyers must purchase a Dash wallet, where the currency will be transferred through.\n\nAnyone thinking of investing in Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency should be very careful.\n\nTheir values are volatile, with the ability to plummet as quickly as they shoot up.\n\nAnd investors are frequently targeted by hackers and other criminals who seek to steal their crypto-cash online.\n\nBe especially careful if you are using direct, peer-to-peer platforms to sell and buy cryptocurrencies."
