In addition to Wyoming's decision on Monday to relax securities laws in the crypto space, it also appears that South Korea won't ban Bitcoin anytime soon.\n\nMeanwhile, Litecoin prices pulled back nearly 14%. The fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has enjoyed a significant amount of attention due to the spin-off of Litecoin Cash and LitePay, but that wasn't enough today to help prices climb today.\n\nBelow is a recap of the top cryptocurrency prices at 3:30 p.m. EST...\n\nNow that we know all of today's price movements, here's what has been moving these cryptocurrencies...\n\nOn Wednesday, the market capitalization of the global cryptocurrency sector hit $454.4 billion.\n\nBitcoin represented 35.8% of the total cryptocurrency market with a market capitalization of $178.4 billion.\n\nThe best performers from the top 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization included DigitDAO (up 14.58%) and Dent (up 14.48%).\n\nThese were the only two cryptocurrencies that had positive gains on the day.\n\nThe worst performers from the top 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization included ZClassic (down -24.13%), Lisk (down -22.13%), Byteball Bytes (down -21.06%), RChain (down -18.29%), ZCoin (down -17.72%), IOSToken (down -17.60%), Golem (down -16.89%), Bitcore (down -16.89%), and FunFair (down -16.64%).\n\nIn positive Bitcoin news, two large cryptocurrency exchanges announced they have implemented SegWit for transactions.\n\nCoinbase announced on Tuesday that it will start rolling out SegWit this week.

The goal of the energy-backed cryptocurrency is to bypass U.S. sanctions as Venezuela's fiat currency continues to plunge.\n\nBacked by the nation's oil reserves (although who is really trusting this regime), the cryptocurrency will have 100 million petros in circulation.\n\nDespite Maduro's claim of $735 million raised, many journalists and cryptocurrency enthusiasts are doubting his estimate.\n\nIn fact, many native Venezuelans have taken to social media to express their concern about the viability of this new cryptocurrency.\n\nMarialbert Barrios, a National Assembly deputy and anti-Maduro advocate, wrote: \"Who in their right mind buys a [cryptocurrency] from a government that does not pay the foreign debt, with an economy in hyperinflation?\"\n\nDid you know we have a free research service that finds the most profitable opportunities in cryptocurrencies today?\n\nIt gives you real-time recommendations and price updates on only the best ways to make money now."
