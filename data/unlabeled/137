"LONDON - The US Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Thursday warned investors to be wary of cryptocurrency \"pump and dump\" scams.\n\n\"Customers should not purchase virtual currencies, digital coins, or tokens based on social media tips or sudden price spikes,\" the CFTC wrote. \"Thoroughly research virtual currencies, digital coins, tokens, and the companies or entities behind them in order to separate hype from facts.\"\n\n\"Pump and dump\" scams occur when people or groups try to \"pump\" the price of digital coins on exchanges by spreading misinformation about them or coordinating buying activity to create false demand. The scammers then attract new buyers over social media or forums to \"dump\" the coins on by convincing them the rally is going to last. It's a problem Business Insider has highlighted as being rife in the market.\n\nThe scam is the same one used by Leonardo DiCaprio's character in \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and the CFTC said: \"Pump-and-dump schemes have been around long before virtual currencies and digital tokens.\n\n\"Historically, they were the domain of \"boiler room\" frauds that aggressively peddled penny stocks by falsely promising the companies were on the verge of major breakthroughs, releasing groundbreaking products, or merging with blue chip competitors.\"\n\nBusiness Insider produced a step-by-step walkthrough of how these scams work last November. At the time, BI was the first publication to highlight the problem with \"pump and dump\" scams in the market.\n\nA 'pump and dump' being organised on messaging app Telegram.

Many are thinly traded, making them easier to manipulate.\n\nThe CFTC said it has received a number of complaints from people who have lost money in \"pump and dump\" scams. It warned people not to buy coins based on social media tips or adverts promising big returns. The regulator also told people not to take part in pump groups on apps like Telegram.\n\nThe CFTC joins the US Securities and Exchange Commission and FINRA in warning consumers to be wary about \"pump and dump\" schemes in the crypto space. The SEC cited BI's investigation into \"pump and dumps\" as part of its paper setting out concerns about potential bitcoin ETFs.\n\nDespite the multiple warnings from regulators, the scams persist as the screenshot taken this week shows. The screenshot was taken from a Telegram group with over 8,000 members."
