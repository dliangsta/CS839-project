But the recent volatility has prompted other bitcoin investors to sell up.\n\n\"There have certainly been a couple of moments where I took the wrong punt,\" said radio DJ and comedian Toby Halligan, who bought his first cryptocurrencies in 2013.\n\n\"There are moments where I made $1,200 over the course of an hour and was excited, and then I lost $1,500 over the course of half an hour.\"\n\nMr Halligan sold most of his remaining coins just weeks ago.\n\n\"I think you remember the losses much more than the gains. You remember your bad decisions much more than your good decisions, and the fluctuations are kind of exhausting,\" he told 7.30.\n\nBitcoin is the best known cryptocurrency.\n\nWhen it began trading in 2009 it was worth almost nothing, but at its peak late last year one bitcoin was worth almost US$20,000.\n\nCrytocurrencies like bitcoin exist only online and use digital data known as blockchain to record every transaction and make sure it's secure.\n\nThose transactions are checked by other users, called bitcoin miners.\n\nImportantly, the whole process is decentralised and there are no banks involved.\n\n\"The potential for it, I think, is huge,\" Mr Cole said.\n\n\"The current coins that exist at the moment may or may not last in the long term, but the really exciting thing for me is [it's] a new way of storing value and ownership.\""
