["The total cryptocurrency market cap has broken $500 bln again today, most top 50 coins in green.\n\nAfter a relatively low start to the month in the crypto market, the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies has again broken $500 bln today, Feb. 17, according to CoinMarketCap. The total market cap is currently around $502 bln at press time.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) has stayed well above the $10,000 mark, currently trading at about $10,830 and up almost 7 percent over a 24-hour period by press time. Ethereum (ETH) is inching closer to passing the $1000 threshold, trading at $969, up almost 3 percent over a 24-hour period by press time.\n\nOf the top ten coins listed on CoinMarketCap, only Litecoin (LTC) is in the red, down about 3 percent at press time. Earlier week Litecoin saw a surge in price following the announcement of the upcoming launch of a LTC-fiat payment service, and a planned hard fork that Litecoin creator called a \"scam\". LTC is currently trading at around $227.\n\nThe steady uptick in prices may have prompted by the bullish news that an anonymous trader purchased around 41,000 Bitcoin between Feb. 9 and Feb. 12, worth around $440 mln today, Marketwatch reported. The purchase reportedly brought the BTC address total up to over 96,000 BTC, or little over $1 bln.", "Atari is venturing into a new business of cryptocurrencies with Atari Token. The company has partnered with a brand Infinity Network, which is the creator of blockchain based Atari Token. The company is also planning to create a new digital entertainment platform using the same. It looks like the crypto has already started to pay off, as the latest Bloomberg report suggests that, the stock of the company has already spiked up to 60%.\n\nAtari is mainly known for arcade games and video games, but the name has been also associated with movies and music as well.\n\nInfinity Network has signed up for a long-term contract to use the name Atari. In exchange for this, the French company gets a minority stake in this new entity.\n\nThe company is creating a new digital platform, which will help the customers to make transactions using Atari Token. The company will continue its partnership with Pairplay to create a \"Pong Coin\" based on Atari Token exclusively for \"crypto casinos\".\n\nEvery US dollar or an Indian rupee printed has to be directly proportional to the gold that country has, the value fluctuates with the actual gold value. However, the cryptocurrency is a digital asset, which works independently. Cryptocurrency value depends on people, if people think it has a value, then the price goes higher or vice versa. Hence there are no entities that actually controls these currencies.\n\nThe creator of the cryptocurrency can limit the number of tokens or coins. It all depends on the demand. The recent rise and fall of the Bitcoin explain this phenomenon in the simplest way. If more people buy, the prices go up or vice versa.", "CryptoWatch Today: Riot Blockchain rout besmirches industry\n\nIt's no surprise that cryptocurrency patents have risen at an extreme rate since the inception of bitcoin in 2008. In fact, the long-term chart of patents looks eerily similar to its price. However, what is surprising is who tops the list.\n\nBank of America has filed for the most Bitcoin patents\n\nThe U.S. banking giant has filed for the most cryptocurrency-related patents according to Bitcoin Patent Report. Bank of America Corp. BAC, -0.75% a name not regularly linked with the digital currency space, has filed for a total of 45 patents since 2008.\n\nMore household names within the sector include Coinplug (39), Alibaba (36), IBM (34) and Mastercard (21). The report also highlighted the geographical makeup of the list.\n\n\"Interestingly, several Chinese companies can be found in the top 10 list, and it turns out that even more Chinese companies are present in the top 50 and top 100 lists,\" according to Bitcoin Patent Report website.\n\nTroubling times ahead for Riot Blockchain\n\nA number of cryptocurrency-related companies made the headlines Friday, as the spotlight continues to hover over publicly traded companies and their transparency in the digital currency space.\n\nColorado-based Riot Blockchain Inc. RIOT, -33.37% was atop the list, falling as much as 35% after a CNBC investigation revealed dubious activity among top-ranking officials.\n\nAt the center of the investigation was CEO John O'Rourke who sold $869,000 worth of shares, in December 2017, which followed a steep selloff in share price. The investigation also uncovered a slew of suspicious activities such as phony shareholder meetings and unattended interviews.\n\nRead: Riot Blockchain's stock rattled after report\n\nElsewhere, the SEC halted trading of three companies regarding the valuation of recent blockchain technology-related acquisitions.

Exchanges might be located outside of the United States, they may not incorporate know-your-customerprotocols, and the relative anonymity of cryptocurrency can make it difficult to track down bad actors. The speed and global nature of these crimes make them much harder to .\n\nHow cryptocurrency pump-and-dumps typically function?\n\n\"Some pump and dumps use false news reports, typically about a famous high-tech business leader or investor who plans to pour millions of dollars into a small, lesser known virtual currency or coin. Other fake news stories have featured major retailers, banks, or credit card companies, announcing plans to partner with one virtual currency or another. Links to the phony stories are also accompanied by posts that create false urgency and tell readers to buy now.\"\n\nThe CFTC's call for caution follows a similar warning from US Securities and Commission chairman Jay Clayton. \"It would shock me if you don't see pump-and-dump schemes in the initial coin offering space,\" said Clayton in September 2017. \"This is an area where I'm concerned about what's going to happen to retail investors.\"", "The Securities and Exchange Commission today suspended trading in three companies amid questions surrounding similar statements they made about the acquisition of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology-related assets.\n\nThe SEC's trading suspension orders state that recent press releases issued by Cherubim Interests Inc. (CHIT), PDX Partners Inc. (PDXP), and Victura Construction Group Inc. (VICT) claimed that CHIT, PDXP, and VICT acquired AAA-rated assets from a subsidiary of a private equity investor in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology among other things. According to the SEC order regarding CHIT, it also announced the execution of a financing commitment to launch an initial coin offering.\n\nAccording to the SEC's orders, there are questions regarding the nature of the companies' business operations and the value of their assets, including in press releases issued beginning in early January 2018. Additionally, the Commission suspended trading in the securities of CHIT because of its delinquency in filing annual and quarterly reports.\n\nIn August 2017, the SEC warned investors to be on alert for companies that may publicly announce ICO or coin/token related events to affect the price of the company's common stock.\n\n\"This is a reminder that investors should give heightened scrutiny to penny stock companies that have switched their focus to the latest business trend, such as cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, or initial coin offerings,\" said Michele Wein Layne, Director of the Los Angeles Regional Office.\n\nUnder the federal securities laws, the SEC can suspend trading in a stock for 10 days and generally prohibit a broker-dealer from soliciting investors to buy or sell the stock again until certain reporting requirements are met.\n\nThe SEC appreciates the assistance of OTC Markets Group Inc. and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.", "The first player to beat the PC game \"MonteCrypto: The Bitcoin Enigma\" will be awarded one whole bitcoin.\n\nAt the time of writing, a single bitcoin is priced at around $10,100 -- though, given the wild swings in bitcoin's price, who knows what it'll be worth when the game officially comes out on February 20th. Motherboard reports that it'll cost $2.\n\nThe game developers, Gem Rose Accent, humorously claim \"this game must be amongst the hardest you've ever played.\" To beat the game and claim your cryptocurrency prize, players will have to navigate through a maze and solve 24 \"mind bending\" puzzles.\n\nThere's a multiplayer aspect to the game, as well, where you can team up with others to find clues and solve the puzzles.\n\nAt the same time, there are no rules as to how you or other players should conduct themselves, at least when it comes to beating the game.

The other two clickable links lead you to a press kit download and the Steam product page, so there's no source code to browse through there.\n\nI obviously pulled up the source code of both the Home and FAQ page and lazily searched for \"clue,\" and I was met with a message that's not visible on the regular FAQ page.

When the LitePay card arrives in the mail, the customer activates it on the LitePay website and creates a cardholder account. Then the customer transfers the Litecoin they want to spend to that account.\n\nThe LitePay card is linked to that account. When the account is funded, the card is ready to use as you would any other pre-paid credit card.\n\nAnd get this - you can use the LitePay card almost anywhere, because it works with the vast Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) network.\n\nWhen used, the card converts the Litecoin amount to the merchant's local currency. The payment is sent instantly to the merchant's bank from the user's LitePay account. According to the LitePay website, the system is available in 41 countries and works with multiple currencies, including U.S. dollars, euros and British pounds.\n\nLitePay makes it much easier for Litecoin owners to spend their cryptocurrency, but there's a lot for merchants to like as well.\n\nThe Cryptocurrency Everyone Else Will Regret Not Owning: To See Tom Gentile's No. 1 Crypto Pick and Exactly How to Trade It, Click Here Now\n\nFor one thing, LitePay does the currency conversion instantly, removing any risk the merchant would have to account for Litecoin price fluctuations. The instant transfer of money is also appealing, as cryptocurrency payments typically involve delays of several minutes or even hours.\n\nBut best of all, a LitePay transaction carries a fee of just 1% - about half the interchange fee that Visa and Mastercard Inc. (NYSE: MA) charge merchants. That could tempt merchants to encourage the use of LitePay over conventional credit cards.\n\nHere's why this is such a big deal and will have a dramatic impact on the entire cryptocurrency sector...", "The three companies, which trade in OTC markets, all announced plans to purchase crypto assets.\n\nCount this as another sign that US regulators are paying closer attention to the nascent cryptocurrency world.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday suspended the trading of three companies after they made announcements that they would dive into crypto, according to a memo dated February 15.\n\nThe suspension, which lasts until March 2, will allow the SEC to look into claims made by Cherubim Interest, PDX Partners, and Victura Construction. The companies have all announced plans to purchase cryptocurrency-related assets, according to the regulator.\n\n\"The SEC's trading suspension orders state that recent press releases issued by CHIT, PDXP, and VICT claimed that the companies acquired AAA-rated assets from a subsidiary of a private equity investor in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, among other things,\" the memo said.\n\nThe agency will also look into Cherubim's plans for an initial coin offering, a cryptocurrency twist on the initial public offering process. The three companies trade in over-the-counter markets.\n\nThe SEC has made it clear that it will closely examine companies that claim to doing business in cryptocurrency. In August, it warned investors about the possibility of companies making crypto announcements to impact their share price.\n\nJay Clayton, the chairman of the regulator, said in January that the agency \"was looking closely at the disclosures of public companies that shift their business models to capitalise on the perceived promise of distributed-ledger technology.\"", "Atari SA -- the shambling corpse holding company that shares a name with the company that made Pong and the Atari 2600 decades ago -- has seen its stock price soar after lending its brand to a couple of ill-defined cryptocurrency efforts.\n\nThe French holding company announced last week that it had traded use of its name for a 15 percent stake in Gibraltar-based Infinity Networks, which will create a cryptocurrency-based \"Atari Token\" platform that could be used to pay for various kinds of \"digital entertainment.\" Atari is also planning to extend its existing partnership with online casino maker Pariplay to create a separate \"Pong Token\" that will be accepted in \"crypto-casinos.\"\n\n\"Given our technological strengths with the development studios, and the global reputation of the Atari brand, we have the opportunity to position ourselves attractively in this sector,\" Atari Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frederic Chesnais said in a statement.\n\nDespite the lack of details, shares in Atari SA are up 52 percent since the February 8 announcement. That mirrors the market exuberance for similarly vague crypto-related announcements from the likes of Kodak, the Long Island Iced Tea Company, and a Hooters franchise. The excitement seems undampened by the recent plunge in the price of Bitcoin.\n\nIf the name Atari Token\" sounds familiar, it might be because the firm previously used that name for its own cross-platform reward points system which could be used to fuel in-game microtransactions. The reuse of the name seems coincidental at this point, though it's possible that the old Atari Tokens could be folded into the new Atari Token brand somehow.\n\nA jump onto the cryptocurrency bandwagon isn't shocking for the company now known as Atari, which seems to form the bulk of its business by trading on the nostalgia value of its brand names. The company has loaned out its name for a Linux-based crowdfunded console, an Atari-branded speaker hat, and a line of Internet of Things devices in recent months.\n\nThat business extends to stringent legal efforts to protect its brand. Last year, Atari sued over a KitKat ad that was similar to Breakout. The year before, the company opposed a gaming trademark that used the words \"Haunted House\" because of a 1982 Atari game with the same name. The year before that, Atari threatened legal action against a game that resembled Tempest.", "American TV comedian Ellen Degeneres tells her live audience to understand Bitcoin by comparing it to a picture of a goat that only exists on the Internet.\n\nAmerican television host Ellen Degeneres took a jab explaining what Bitcoin (BTC) was to her live audience yesterday, Feb. 15, by comparing the digital currency to a goat that \"doesn't exist except for on that Internet.\"\n\nIf you want to know what bitcoin is, I learned about it.

Nobody. Everybody's talking about Bitcoin and nobody understands it. It's like a plot twist in a confusing movie.\"\n\nWhile her comparison of Bitcoin's digital nature as similar to that of a picture of a cute goat that only exists online doesn't fully transmit a solid understanding of cryptocurrency, Degeneres does correctly explain that BTC works \"sort of like the stock market\" and that one can store their Bitcoin in a digital wallet that can either be off or online.\n\nDue to the recent market volatility that brought Bitcoin's price up to $20,000 in December and below $7000 in February -- not quite the \"$20,000 or nothing\" that Degeneres says -- she sees Bitcoin as a \"digital Antiques Roadshow\" that can make you either \"a millionaire or totally broke.\"\n\nA lack of consumer understanding of cryptocurrencies is often cited as the reason more government regulation is needed. EU regulators have again cautioned potential crypto investors against investing in something whose risks they don't understand, and the IMF chief recently cited a \"herd mentality\" as a cause for needing crypto regulation.\n\nCommentators on Reddit overall liked the non-technical nature of Degeneres's Bitcoin explanation, user FalcoLamborghini writing that \"considering the audience, this was actually good for BTC.\"\n\nEven after her research into what Bitcoin is, Degeneres still tells her audience,\n\n\"Personally, I'd rather own a baby goat\"", "Billionaire investor Peter Thiel is moving to Los Angeles from San Francisco and has considered scaling back his involvement with Silicon Valley -- perhaps even leaving Facebook's board.

In a surprise move, the company now aims to claw its way back into relevance by launching a cryptocurrency dubbed Atari Token.\n\nAfter its glory days in the 1980s, Atari has lingered on as little more than a symbol of the past in the eyes of the general public. The company was eventually bought by Infogrames and went bankrupt around 2013.\n\nSince the cryptocurrency announcement, its share price has jumped by about 60%.\n\n\"Blockchain technology is poised to take a very important place in our environment and to transform, if not revolutionize, the current economic ecosystem, especially in the areas of the video game industry and online transactions.

Atari is likely to use this token to advance the expansion of its alliance with gambling company PariPlay by allowing players to use digital currencies.\n\nAtari is not the first company - and probably won't be the last - to experience a boost in its share price after announcing the release of its own cryptocurrency.\n\nKodak had similar ambitions, launching an ICO for token-based cryptocurrency protection, only to delay its sale and experience a slight drop in its share price earlier this month.

Any local exchange is of great interest to both Korean and international traders. When companies such as Upbit add a new coin to be traded, there will be a genuine interest in it. In the case of 0x, it will be interesting to see how it performs in South Korea. The addition of XRZ to Upbit may herald a new era for this project as a whole.\n\nSouth Korea has become the new China for alternative cryptocurrencies. More specifically, it was very important for altcoins to get listed on Chinese exchanges in the past. Such developments often resulted in major price gains and overall positive momentum. Ever since China became a trivial cog in the cryptocurrency machine, South Korea has taken its place. Any currency listed on Korean exchanges is worth keeping an eye on. Upbit, the country's second-largest exchange, is adding new coins on a rather regular basis right now.\n\nTheir latest addition comes in the form of ZRX, the native token of the 0x protocol. It is an interesting choice, for many different reasons. A lot of people consider 0x to be the cryptocurrency-related protocol worth keeping an eye on. This decentralized exchange framework is of great interest to a lot of traders. Slowly but surely, the industry is moving to decentralized exchanges rather than centralized counterparts. Even so, companies such as Upbit will always have a place in the world of cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nWith the Korean exchange now listing 0x as a trading market, an interesting situation is created. It seems the company lists all tokens traded on the Bittrex exchange. More specifically, 0x was added to Bittrex yesterday. Not long after, Upbit does exactly the same. An interesting correlation between both companies. It does appear the volume for both exchanges is picking up as a result of this addition. On Upbit, 0x has generated over $12.1m in volume over the past 24 hours. Bittrex generates a nearly identical volume as of right now.\n\nWith these exchanges supporting 0x, the price is also on the rise. Many speculators consider exchange listings to be good for the price overall. More liquidity in the market is never a bad thing either. If Upbit can generate a decent trading volume, things will start looking good for ZRX. Getting listed on Korea's second-largest exchange is no small feat. For now, it remains to be seen what type of impact this news will have.", "Having found weak hands above the $10,200 mark in Asian hours, bitcoin has slipped back into four figures.\n\nThe cryptocurrency rose above $10,000 at 17:29 UTC yesterday, but ran into offers at $10,218 and dropped to $9,865.29 at 21:59 UTC.

However, as seen in the chart below, the volumes have dropped in the subsequent hours, explaining the failure to post solid gains above $10,000.\n\nAlso, as discussed earlier this week, the weekly chart remains bearish, thus a struggle to hold above $10,000 should not come as a surprise.

This is akin to purchasing gold at 1% above spot price, which is extremely attractive.\n\nMany businesses and merchants are keen to come onboard the Gold Commerce Platform to offer their products and services and accept payment via PG Pay (Puregold Pay).

At the time of writing this article, the price was sitting at $10,009 per coin. Despite what the doom sayers have been espousing, it doesn't look like this cryptocurrency is going to become worthless any time soon.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies saw a downward shift in their prices after January 6th, having previously fell slightly in the last half of December. By February 6th, bitcoin had reached its lowest point of $6,300 but has recovered remarkably well in the nine days since despite gloomy press coverage and a bitcoin purchasing ban imposed by Lloyds Banking Group on its credit card customers. The upward trend effectively ends what came to be known by bulls as the \"January Sales\".\n\nJust a few days ago, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, Jesse Powell, sat down with CNBC and stated that he believed the entire cryptocurrency market will reach a staggering $1 trillion valuation this year. If that target is to be achieved, the prices of bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies are going to soar in price once again.\n\nThis year should see some bottlenecks in the bitcoin network become resolved. One of the main issues plaguing bitcoin right now is the cost of transfer fees which are easily reaching $10 or more; such fees will likely be decimated as more exchanges and wallets such as Coinbase start migrating to SegWit. Going on from there, work to implement something called the 'Lightning Network' is happening but that may not see widespread use this year; once adopted should bring any remaining transfer fees down to almost nil.\n\nSource: CoinMarketCap", "Last November, the price of bitcoin crossed the $10,000 level for the first time. The rest of 2017 was an explosive ride, shooting up near $20,000 per coin before closing out the year just above $13,400.\n\nNow, we're right back to last November, making note of bitcoin breaking above $10,000 Thursday midday for the first time in two weeks.\n\nOf course, the atmosphere is quite different. Bitcoin futures have launched, regulators have stepped in more aggressively and the price of the largest cryptocurrency has tumbled nearly 50 percent from its all-time high.\n\nIn this environment, this week, \"bitcoin $10,000\" has taken on meaning unlike what we saw last year. If we could see the coin hold this level significantly, then it will start the next wave higher, attracting fresh capital into the market after the recent massive sell-off.\n\nThe aggressive sell-off from over $19,000 late last year to just above $7,000 earlier this month was most likely the crypto bubble burst that we'd all been waiting for, clearing out all those late to the party.\n\nRelaxation from South Korean officials in their efforts to halt bitcoin speculation has started to again build confidence in the market, along with a rise in other major cryptocurrencies, such as litecoin and ethereum. Hedgers, too, have pared back activity as the price has fallen.\n\nAt this time, we seem to be witnessing a sort of test phase in how outside markets are intermingling with bitcoin's price. With bitcoin futures trading for two months, we are beginning to see a clearer picture of how equity and currency markets are impacting them.\n\nFor instance, the S&P 500 tested its 200-day moving average on Feb. 6, just as bitcoin tested its contract low at $5,940. Does this mean that if U.S. equities continue running higher after their recent tumble, bitcoin will have a chance to retest that $20,000 mark?\n\nTime will tell.", "If you thought that Kodak was the only company from days gone by that was jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon, think again.

The Bitcoin price headlined the advance, testing the $10,000 for the first time since Feb. 1. Ripple, meanwhile, surged on the surprising news that money transfer behemoth Western Union is trialing XRP integration in a pilot program.\n\nThe rally briefly raised the cryptocurrency market cap above $475 billion, which constituted a two-week high, although it has since ebbed back to a present value of $471.6 billion.\n\nBitcoin continued to defy its critics on Thursday, posting a six percent advance and raising its price within striking distance of $10,000 for the first time since the beginning of February. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has thus far been able to break through that barrier and it is now trading at $9,860 after rising as high as $9,946 earlier in the day. Bitcoin now has a market cap of $166.8 billion, which has enabled its market share to tick up to 35.3 percent.\n\nThe Ethereum price joined Bitcoin in its rally, although its advance could not quite keep pace with that of its older sister.

As such, they're a bad form of money.\n\nJPMorgan made that case in a wide-ranging note on cryptocurrencies sent out to clients on Friday. While the bank said it may make sense for some investors to include digital currencies in their portfolios as a hedge, it doesn't view any cryptocurrency as a \"legitimate competitor\" to sovereign currencies.\n\n\"The huge volatility of the price of cryptocurrencies-with respect to either traditional currencies or to a basket of goods and services-has made use of cryptocurrencies as a unit of account impractical,\" the bank said. \"Only hobbyists are using cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange, at least for conventional transactions for goods and services.\"\n\nThis point has been made by some of the most notable Wall Streeters, including Bridgewater's Ray Dalio and OakTree Capital's Howard Marks.

This particular natural monopoly arises as a result of the inherent network externalities: pricing a New York meal in yen makes little sense as almost all customers will be holding dollars.\"\n\nThe only area where cryptocurrencies could compete with national currencies as a medium of exchange, according to the bank, is in the black market.\n\nThe bank's argument echoes that of its chief executive Jamie Dimon, who in September 2017 famously called bitcoin \"a fraud.\" The billionaire banker, who has since stepped away from those comments, also once said bitcoin is only useful for criminals and \"a kind of novelty.\"", "By Maiya Keidan and Jemima Kelly\n\nLONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The number of hedge funds focused on trading cryptocurrencies more than doubled in the four months to Feb. 15, despite sharp falls in the value of the virtual coins in recent weeks, data from fintech research house Autonomous NEXT showed on Thursday.\n\nThe firm recorded a record high of 226 global hedge funds with such a strategy, up from 110 global hedge funds as of Oct. 18.

We are cognizant of the matter and are monitoring it regularly.\"\n\nCitibank, too, in an email notification to customers said that due to concerns raised by RBI, it has decided to ban the usage of its debit and cards to buy virtual currencies.\n\nRBI has reportedly warned banks about cryptocurrencies in January, telling them to step up scrutiny of financial transactions by companies and exchanges involved in the trade of bitcoins and similar digital tender. However, the apex bank is yet to declare such transactions illegal. The central bank's has asked banks to understand how these currencies work before dealing with such companies. Besides, the RBI has also been periodically issuing notifications cautioning various stakeholders regarding the risks of virtual currencies.\n\nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Budget 2018 speech said that 'government does not consider crypto-currencies legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system'. At the same time, Jaitley did not declare cryptocurrencies illegal. Therefore, the legal status of cryptocurrencies continues to be in a limbo.\n\nGlobally, banks and other financial institutions are seen taking precautionary measures since cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and customers who purchase these virtual currencies using their credit cards may not be able to clear their dues if they are hit hard by a price crash.

At the current market price of $16.28 per share, Bitcoin Investment Trust implies a market value of roughly $16,163 per bitcoin.\n\nOn digital currency exchanges, bitcoin trades at a lower price -- for approximately $9,274 each on GDAX. Bitcoin prices on GDAX are up about 6.5% from when the stock market closed on Tuesday, while Bitcoin Investment Trust is up about 13% over the same period. The differential is due to the trust's premium, which is expanding today.\n\nI estimate the Bitcoin Investment Trust currently trades at a price about 75% higher than the value of the bitcoin it owns on behalf of its shareholders. Investors have long been willing to pay a high price for the convenience of speculating on bitcoin with their brokerage accounts rather than simply buying the cryptocurrency on online exchanges, though the premium ebbs and flows with speculative interest in the cryptocurrency.\n\nWhere bitcoin and Bitcoin Investment Trust will trade from here is anyone's guess, as they frequently trade in different directions.

Based on historical prices, Bitcoin Investment Trust trades at a premium of 70% or higher on only about 20% of trading days.

Bitcoin touched a high of $8,973.12 a day before. However, it's a long way down from the high of $19,783 it touched on December 17 last year. Cryptocurrency experts claim that it will take time for Bitcoin to match the record highs that the virtual currency touched in the second half of the last year. Bitcoin was at six-day highs over the weekend recording its price at $9,000. However, just after it declined to go below $8,000 briefly on Sunday only to take a climb once again. Bitcoin's price is over 40 percent above last week's low of $5,947.40.\n\nForbes, the popular American business magazine, last week came out with a list of Bitcoin millionaires. It was the first of its kind ever and got the heads talking in real sense. Cryptocurrencies especially Bitcoin received further shot in the arm after South Korean Prime Minister last week announced that cryptocurrencies wouldn't be in any danger of being shut down, provided they go by the rules.\n\nBitcoin was traded aggressively last year, all across the world. Even Indian investors invested huge sums in the digital currency. This resulted in the virtual currency almost touching a record figure of $20,000. However, it was soon followed by a nearly 30 percent plunge which resulted in millions of dollars getting eroded in worth all across the world.\n\nIn budget 2018, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced that cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin are not a legal tender. This announcement impacted the cryptocurrency in such a way that exchange servers were said to have come to a halt for the following two days, as a result of this sudden spurt in transactions. However, platforms themselves said that things settled down after the initial panic.\n\nJust weeks back, Nouriel Roubini, the man who rightly predicted the housing crash in US way back in 2008 termed Bitcoin as mother of all bubbles that will burst anytime soon. He even compared it to Mississippi bubble, tech bubble, and Tulip mania. He also predicted that the popular digital currency is on its way down to zero since it lacks any fundamental value.", "Verisign released its latest report of the top trending keywords in new .com domain name registrations, and something is noticeably absent for January: cryptocurrency terms.\n\nFor months, domain names including terms such as coin and crypto have been on the trending list. But this month none of the top ten spots include these terms.\n\nThere are a couple possible reasons for this.\n\nFirst, the trending terms list looks at the percentage month-over-month increase in domains registered that contain the word. It's harder to grow percentage-wise as the base gets bigger.\n\nSecond, crypto-related domain names have been largely picked over.\n\nYou might also argue that interest in cryptocurrencies is starting to wane with price drops, but I wouldn't write that on a blog like this and have crypto bettors fill up the comments with hate comments.", "SAN FRANCISCO -- Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse may be the man behind the popular cryptocurrency XRP, but that doesn't mean he has faith that every single token will survive.\n\nSpeaking to an audience of analysts at the Goldman Sachs' Technology and Internet Conference on Tuesday, Garlinghouse said he believes \"most\" cryptocurrencies will eventually lose all of their value. In short, he believes that most of these coins are simply not very useful as a transactional currency, meaning there's no reason for them to exist.\n\n\"It's not clear what the use case is. It's not clear the what value proposition is,\" he told the audience. \"Long term value will be dictated by the utility of that asset.\"\n\nXRP, which peaked $3.31 in January before falling to $0.99 at the time of writing, has caught the eye of investors because of its use within the Ripple payments system. Essentially, XRP is a token very specifically intended for doing fast and low-cost international transactions between banks. To Garlinghouse's point, that is the purpose of XRP.\n\nXRP holds the third highest market cap of any cryptocurrency, at $40.1 billion. Still, some have criticized Ripple for holding the majority of XRP in company reserves, thus giving the company more influence over the price of the coin. This is in contrast to bitcoin, where inflation is determined by the rate at which \"miners\" generate new coins.\n\nThough Garlinghouse's stance may seem rigid for someone whose company has come into prominence thanks to the recent crypto-craze, he hasn't written off all digital currencies.\n\nGarlinghouse gave nod to the idea that bitcoin -- which he says is 1000 times slower and more expensive than XRP -- will still be used as a store of value, similar to the role that gold has played for . But it won't be used for payments, in his opinion.\n\n\"Bitcoin is going to solve a different problem,\" he said.", "The crypto market continues to struggle today, but many of the top ten cryptocurrencies are just on the cusp of being up rather than down. Cardano (ADA) and Litecoin (LTC) are included here, each altcoin with less than a 1% loss at the moment.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why the crypto market might be down today. First, several more warnings against crypto were released recently, including Thailand restricting its banks from being involved in crypto anything and the European Supervisory Authorities adding their two cents in about the risks of crypto trading.\n\nA lot of the time when either of the two big cryptos, Bitcoin and Ethereum, are down, as is the case right now, many altcoins follow suit. The reason behind this correlation might be as simple as people noticing that Bitcoin or Ethereum are down, so they want in while the door is open. Holders of altcoins might trade away their tokens to get a piece of either Bitcoin or Ethereum while they're down. This, in turn, would cause altcoin prices to decrease. This isn't necessarily what is happening currently, but it is a potential explanation.\n\nWhatever is making the market slow today, the impact isn't massive at least. Within the top 100 cryptocurrencies, 26 are currently up. Stellar and EOS continue to be the only coins in the top ten that are up at the time of writing. However, many coins within the top ten aren't far from crossing into the green, Cardano and Litecoin included.\n\nCardano is the 5th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. As of right now, the coin is selling for $0.379417, which puts the altcoin down by only 0.08% in the past 24 hours.\n\nAs can be seen from the chart above, ADA has been all over the place in the last 24 hours. The coin looks to be moving up now but based on its latest movements, I don't know how long that will last.\n\n>> Cardano price analysis\n\nLike Cardano, Litecoin is just barely in the red. The 6th largest cryptocurrency is currently selling for $160.45, which puts LTC down only 0.48% in the past 24 hours.\n\nLitecoin's price movements have also been fairly sporadic today.", "Most people have absolutely no idea what Litecoin is, or that the sixth cryptocurrency of the world by market cap is about to get a fork of its own much like Bitcoin did last year. Some of those who are aware of Litecoin probably know that Litecoin Cash is coming soon, \"sold\" as a faster version of Litecoin when it comes to transaction times.\n\nWhatever the case, you should stay away from Litecoin Cash right now, as the actual founder of Litecoin sees it as a potential scam.\n\nOne of the worries with cryptocurrencies these days and the number one reason why regulation is needed is that anyone can launch their own digital coin and scam people out of money. Rinse and repeat when you're done, there's no law to stop you.\n\nThat's probably why someone other than the Litecoin creator is now looking to launch a fork that has \"Litecoin\" in its name.\n\nAs Business Insider explains, Litecoin owners will get 10 Litecoin Cash coins for each Litecoin unit they have when the forks will happen sometime next week. That sounds like a sweet deal, especially if you bought Litecoin token when the price was really low -- the coin rose from $3.73 a year ago to $365 in December before plunging to $150-ish right now.\n\nBut you should handle Litecoin Cash with immense care. Just because it has \"Litecoin\" in its name doesn't make it a legit endeavor.\n\nThe goal of the Litecoin Cash coin is, as stated before to increase \"blood speed\" to 2.5 minutes. That's the speed at which the network can process transactions, which should be faster than Litecoin's. On paper.\n\nBut it's not known who operates Litecoin Cash, other than the fact they hide behind the Litecoin Cash Foundation.\n\nLitecoin is currently trading at $157.06, some 0.12% lower than yesterday, so the incoming Litecoin Cash fork is yet to dent Litecoin's market cap or reputation.", "A cryptocurrency investment scheme that last month drew the ire of state regulators in Texas announced last week that it was closing its lending platform.\n\nDavorCoin, as previously reported, was likened to BitConnect by the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) given that both involved the use of a lending site and had promised to pay steady interest income to those who invested. On Feb. 2, the board issued a cease-and-desist to Davorcoin, alleging at the time that those behind the scheme had intentionally hidden information from would-be stakeholders.\n\n\"The emergency order found that DavorCoin is telling investors they can earn lucrative profits by investing in a lending program based on a new cryptocurrency known as davorcoin. Investors allegedly purchase davorcoin and then lend it to DavorCoin,\" TSSB wrote at the time.\n\nLess than a week later, those behind DavorCoin announced that they were closing the associated lending platform because of a plunge in the value of the scheme's DAV token.\n\nAccording to data from CoinMarketCap, the price nearly hit $180 just over a month ago, but by the day of the announcement, the value of DAV was around $3. Press-time data indicates that DAV's value has plunged even further, coming in at roughly $0.03 at press time.\n\nThe team wrote in the Feb. 7 blog post:\n\n\"There is no doubt for us that the DAV value has been negatively affected by our lending program because the crypto-environment has dramatically changed recently. We did everything possible to protect our platform and our amazing community. However, DAV price still went from $180 to $0.5 in 20 days. As a result, we have decided to change our strategy and to end our lending program that has become the only reason why DavorCoin is decreasing in value.\"\n\nThe blog goes on to state that those behind DavorCoin will seek to resuscitate its price through \"transforming DAV into a strong cryptocurrency.\" Yet since that date, there have been no official posts on its Medium and Twitter accounts.\n\nImage via Shutterstock", "Bitcoin's price may be down more than 50% from its highs in December, but no one has told Iceland, where the cryptocurrency and its offspring are reshaping the economy.\n\nAccording to Johann Snorri Sigurbergsson, an employee of the energy company HS Orka, Icelandic cryptocurrency \"mining\" is likely to double its energy consumption to about 100 megawatts this year. That is more than households use in the nation of 340,000 people, according to the national energy authority.\n\nMining is the name for the decentralised process that underpins the integrity of most cryptocurrencies. Effectively, a bunch of computers engage in a race to burn through the most electricity possible and, every 10 minutes, one wins a prize of 12.5 bitcoin for the effort - still worth more than $100,000, despite recent falls.\n\nAs the price of bitcoin has risen, so too has the amount of electricity that it is economical to use in order to get the rewards. One recent estimate pegged the energy consumption of the entire network as equivalent to that of the Republic of Ireland.\n\nBut the news from Iceland is the first time cryptocurrency mining within one nation has overtaken productive uses of electricity. Why is Iceland so popular? The answer is simple: location, location and volcanoes. Volcanoes provide Iceland with a cheap and abundant form of renewable energy. Geothermal and hydroelectric plants abound on the island, driving down the wholesale cost of power, which lets bitcoin miners make higher profits as they run their computers 24/7, 365 days a year.\n\nThe country's location, at the northernmost tip of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, provides a second benefit beyond a lot of magma. The Arctic air reduces the need to invest in expensive air-conditioning for the server rooms - crucial, since the specialised chips used to mine most cryptocurrencies produce huge amounts of heat when run at their maximum efficiency.\n\nOf course, even efficient cooling won't help miners eke out profits if the price of bitcoin falls too far. But at least one company based in Reykjavik can handle quite a bit more devaluation: Genesis Mining moved there in 2014 from Germany, when the price of bitcoin was well under $1,000. \"What we are doing here is like gold mining,\" Helmut Rauth, the company's operations manager, told AP. Of course, gold mines eventually run dry.

Investor anxieties about a frothy market, cryptocurrency hacks, and the potential of a regulatory crackdown in some Asian countries have since dragged the entire market for digital coins to half of its peak worth.\n\nNow, conditions may be forming for a sell-off towards $US4,605, according to chart-readers at JPMorgan.

Bonds which cannot fluctuate in price the way cryptocurrency can on the open market.\n\nNeighborly, the Berkeley startup that allows residents to invest directly in projects that benefit the Bay area, sees the ICO as a debut of technology they have been creating to make Cryptobonds possible.\n\nThe new Republican tax overhaul which lowered corporate taxes last year also decreased the value of cities tax credits leaving less money for homeless services.

Is it worth it to get a loan in order to invest money into bitcoin? Virtual currency has lately been extraordinarily popular, and it is being used in a lot of sectors as the main payment system. This article is meant to answer the most asked question related to this topic: is it worth to invest into bitcoin? Read the pieces of information below and all your uncertainties will be gone in minutes.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) is a type of electronic currency, also called cryptocurrency, which is developed by people and companies all around the world. What one needs to understand about cryptocurrency is the fact that it has no physical form. The bitcoin network is not controlled by anyone or anything, but the users who are buying or selling.\n\nThe answer is yes, you can lose money while investing into bitcoins. This is the reason why you will have to be very convinced of your winning rate, especially if you get a loan just for this purpose. You can lose money in a very short period of time, keeping in mind that the price of a bitcoin fluctuates terribly from one day to another. The system is not pyramidal, and it relies on your ability to analyze the fluctuations that occur with time. You will have to understand how it works and invest in bitcoin at the most appropriate time. If you are not doing so, you are going to risk a large amount of money. This happens especially when investors rush in making a certain decision.\n\nYes, the price does fluctuate. Investing in bitcoin is risky. The cryptocurrency market is very volatile. One year the bitcoin can cost a few dollars, it can go up to $1000 the next month and drop back to its initial amount a while after. If you are an active type of investor, you can make monthly purchases and sale of bitcoins, which can result in great returns. Don't forget that these investments are taxable, like all other investments out there and any earnings are going to be taxed according to your state affiliation. It depends on the income statement how the profit is going to be calculated.", "The value of a piece of art is often hotly debated and can sometimes appear fairly arbitrary.

But with a 53% jump in less than 24 hours Tron is on a flyer at the moment.\n\nSocial media has been vicious to Tron and its founder. For some reason this altcoin has hit a nerve with the Facebook fanboys that have been bleating on about it for some weeks. It has probably suffered a greater FUD attack than any other cryptocurrency out there, with the possible exception of Verge, and this may be due to the huge attack of FOMO causing the coin to spike from virtually nothing to $0.25 on January 5.\n\nSince then it has been on a downward slide with all other altcoins. Today however Tron is over 50% higher than its trading price the same time yesterday. Currently trading at $0.054 TRX has seen the largest upward movement in the top 25 altcoins this morning.

Just two months ago, the darling of the cryptocurrency world was riding the $20k wave. In addition, major financial institutions either voiced their initial support or swallowed a healthy serving of humble pie along with their previous crypto critique.\n\nThen the last few weeks happened.

The blue line indicates the percentage of value lost during each selloff. And while this latest selloff could be tough for HODLers who are checking their accounts this week, it's not the worst. Bitcoin lost 87% of its value in the 411 days from Nov. 30, 2013, through Jan. 14, 2015.\n\nIt lost 83% of its value in just three days between April 10, 2013, and April 12, 2013.
