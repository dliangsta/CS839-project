"Reality TV star and socialite Kylie Jenner wiped $1.3bn (\u00a3900m) off the stock market value of Snap, the software company behind Snapchat, with a single tweet last night.\n\nThe social messaging app, already reeling from the negative reaction to a recent update to its interface, now finds itself struggling to regain momentum after the star's criticism was retweeted more than 60,000 times (and counting).\n\nBut Jenner is only one of several celebrities whose interventions have shaken the markets.\n\nKylie Jenner\n\nThe Kardashian sibling's tweet, which reached 24.5m followers and caused a 7 per cent drop in Snapchat's value, \"underlines the fragility of social networking platforms from a corporate finance perspective\", according to John Illsley, director at accountancy firm Moore Stephens.\n\nNew platforms like Snapchat are more vulnerable to challenges from influential opposition voices as they lack the loyalty cultivated over time enjoyed by more established brands, according to Illsley.\n\nWhether Jenner's tweet represents a temporary blip for Snapchat or has done more lasting damage to its value remains to be seen.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nThe US President has often exploited his social media influence to rattle corporations.\n\nOne of the most notable examples was an attack on Boeing in December 2016, arguing that \"costs are out of control\" on the aircraft manufacturer's proposed new Air Force One commission, a 747 being built for $4bn (\u00a32.9bn). \"Cancel order!\" he typed, sending stock tumbling by almost $2 (\u00a31.43) a share.\n\nTrump followed this by attacking Lockheed Martin over the expense of its F-35 fighter jet programme for the US Air Force.\n\nThis in turn caused shares to fall by more than five per cent and shaved $3.5bn (\u00a32.5bn) from the aerospace giant's market value before it recovered.\n\nIn January 2017, he did the same to Toyota, wiping $1.2bn (\u00a3859m) from the Japanese carmarker's value after he expressed his opposition to the company's proposed relocation of its manufacturing operations from the US to Mexico.\n\nTrump also used his account to criticise luxury department store Nordstrom in February 2017 for declining to carry his daughter Ivanka's clothing line - an \"outrageous\" abuse of his office for business purposes, according to former Barack Obama ethics adviser Norm Eisen.\n\nNordstrom's stock dropped a full 1 per cent in value - 23p a share - within a minute of Trump's tweet before recovering moments later.\n\nOprah Winfrey Oprah Winfrey accepts the 2018 Cecil B. DeMille Award during the 75th Annual Golden Globe Awards (Paul Drinkwater/NBC Universal/Getty)\n\nThe beloved chat show host and actress sent Weight Watchers stock soaring 14 per cent last month after she gave an inspirational speech at the Golden Globes that went viral.\n\nShares in the weight loss company - in which Oprah owns a 10 per cent stake - achieved a top price of $53.60 (\u00a338.30) apiece as a result of the address, which was so impressive it led many to speculate on whether a future presidential run might be in the pipeline.\n\nMichelle Obama\n\nThe former US First Lady also benefited a major brand when she went viral. Mrs Obama wore an \u00a38,575 Versace rose gold gown to a White House State Dinner in October 2016 with then-Italian PM Matteo Renzi.\n\nWall Street saw an immediate rise in the company's share value and dubbed her \"mark-up Michelle\" in tribute.\n\nJohn McAfee\n\nThe eccentric anti-virus software mogul has recently taken to addressing his Twitter followers on the benefits of \"altcoins\" - minor cryptocurrencies smaller than Bitcoin traded on wildly volatile markets.\n\nOn 15 December, McAfee tweeted that a new altcoin called SAFEX constituted \"the majority of my holdings\", implying it was a sound investment for others to follow.\n\nMoments later the price of SAFEX shot up by 92 per cent, according to CoinMarketCap, before settling down.\n\nBusiness picture of the day 7 show all Business picture of the day 1/7\n\nTrinity Mirror, which owns the Daily Mirror, is set to incorporate the parent company of the Daily Express, Sunday Express and the Daily Star.

It came after Aldi customer Pat Batemen complained to the budget supermarket chain and was offered \u00a330 compensation, a figure she said was later increased to \u00a3500.\n\n6/7\n\nCoronation Street is set to get its own Co-op supermarket and Costa Coffee branch in a landmark deal that will see shop fronts appearing on a show as product placements. Viewers of the ITV soap will see both stores open on the street this spring. Co-op's and Costa Coffee's facades will be seen on the show, alongside branded posters, bags and cups used by Coronation Street characters.\n\n7/7\n\nJohn Lewis, M&S, Next, Debenhams and Sainsbury's are all yet to add their names to a list of brands binding themselves to Bangladesh's latest laws on fire and building safety. The renewed agreement will see greater investment in health and safety checks come into effect this year as the original 2013 agreement is due to expire in May.\n\nREUTERS\n\nHe repeated the trick a week later promoting a different altcoin named Electroneum, its price spiking 57 per cent, and has since done the same for BURST, Digibyte and others.\n\nInterestingly, only two - Humaniq and Factom - have failed to climb back up to their McAfee-inspired peak following the inevitable post-recommendation slump, according to Motherboard.\n\nPerhaps getting in on the act, pop star Katy Perry recently posted pictures of her fingernails painted with cryptocurrency logos on Instagram.\n\nWhether this is a precursor to a McAfee-style promotional onslaught remains unclear, but Perry is the most followed person on Twitter and could certainly be an altcoin influencer if she chose to weaponise her fan base.\n\nMore about: Kylie Jenner Snapchat Stock Markets Donald Trump Oprah Winfrey Michelle Obama John McAfee Reuse content"
