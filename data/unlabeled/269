The company's CEO Brad Garlinghouse has publicly said that Ripple \"works within the system,\" and is not opposed to the traditional financial system.\n\nThere is no doubt some CryptoCurrencies with fail, some will be scams, and some will live on to change the very nature of money and wealth, no wonder the old dudes are scared.\n\nOpen your G-BiT X Account today.\n\nCryptoCurrencies is not about Tax Evasion or Money Laundering, real hardcore fundamental CryptoCurrency Exchanges like G-BiT have seriously tackled the Money Laundering and Tax issues, that's why they have such a bright future.
