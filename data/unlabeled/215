"Ripple prices have come full circle with the broad based rally in cryptocurrencies this week paring the early-February losses. The advance takes prices into monthly open resistance and while prices may be vulnerable here near-term the broader outlook remains constructive.\n\nTechnical Outlook: Ripple prices are up over 100% off the February lows with the advance now testing monthly open resistance at 1.1407. An ascending pitchfork formation extending off the January lows keeps the focus higher while above near-term support at ~9646 where the 100-day moving average converges on the 50-line. Broader bullish invalidation remains steady at the 2018 low-day close at 7600.\n\nNew to Forex Trading?

Interim resistance targets eyed at 1.2203 backed by the median-line / 61.8% extension at 1.2956 - a breach there would be needed to fuel the next leg higher in price with such a scenario targeting subsequent resistance objectives at 1.5457 backed closely by 1.6177.\n\nBottom line: The immediate advance looks a bit vulnerable here but the broader focus remains weighted to the topside while above the monthly / yearly low-day close. From a trading standpoint, I'll favor fading weakness into structural support OR buying a break and retest of the median-line (1.2956) as support for a move back towards the 1.6177.\n\nFor a complete breakdown of Michael's trading strategy, review his Foundations of Technical Analysis mini-series\n\n- Written by Michael Boutros, Currency Strategist with DailyFX"
