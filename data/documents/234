"Having found weak hands above the $10,200 mark in Asian hours, bitcoin has slipped back into four figures.\n\nThe cryptocurrency rose above $10,000 at 17:29 UTC yesterday, but ran into offers at $10,218 and dropped to $9,865.29 at 21:59 UTC. Another attempt to score gains above the $10,000 mark ran out of steam at a high of $10,293.44 at 02:14 UTC. As of writing, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) is seen at $9,960.\n\nDespite the pullback from a 16-day high of $10,293.44, the cryptocurrency is still up 1.56 percent on a 24-hour basis, according to data source CoinMarketCap.\n\nOn Bifinex (the biggest exchange by volume), trading volumes surged as BTC rose above $10,000 yesterday. However, as seen in the chart below, the volumes have dropped in the subsequent hours, explaining the failure to post solid gains above $10,000.\n\nAlso, as discussed earlier this week, the weekly chart remains bearish, thus a struggle to hold above $10,000 should not come as a surprise. Further, the shorter-duration technical charts indicate scope for a further drop towards $9,000.\n\nDisclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.\n\nPlaying cards image via Shutterstock"
