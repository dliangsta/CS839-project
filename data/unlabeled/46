"In response to a CNBC investigatory report calling to question Riot Blockchain Inc (NASDAQ: RIOT)'s sincere participation in blockchain, CEO John O'Rourke penned a shareholder letter decrying the piece and justifying the firm's pursuits.\n\n\"CNBC released a negative one-sided piece on companies that seek to jump on the blockchain bandwagon by changing their name to profit from an increase in their stock price and profiled our company,\" O'Rourke wrote Friday. \"Had the journalist used even a modest amount of professional diligence, CNBC would have also reported on the numerous achievements we have made in becoming an early entrant in the support of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.\"\n\nO'Rourke claimed the company, formerly a biotech called Bioptix, transitioned to blockchain after failing to secure FDA approval and suffering a cash-bleeding acquisition.\n\n\"It is not uncommon for businesses to pivot and change their business strategy,\" he wrote. \"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) started off selling books.\"\n\nThe timing and sincerity of the company's blockchain interest were further defended. By O'Rourke's account, Riot was the first to add \"blockchain\" to its name and thus could not have anticipated the market reaction.\n\n\"Other companies may have tried to hop on the 'cryptocurrency bandwagon,' perhaps partially as a result of our success,\" he said.\n\nAfter deciding in January 2017 to transition, Riot claims it streamlined its workforce and reduced cash burn by July. In August, the firm made its first official move into blockchain with an investment in Coinsquare.\n\nBe the first to get this news with Benzinga Pro.

It did not make sense to go through the time and expense of potentially having two shareholder meetings within a matter of months.\"\n\nHe confirmed the meeting will occur in the second quarter.\n\nO'Rourke further confirmed his commitment to transparency.\n\n\"We take our SEC reporting obligations seriously and diligently file all reports and filings,\" O'Rourke said. \"We have expended enormous effort to inform investors of the risks of our foray into uncharted territory. We have an open and expansive dialogue with the SEC Division of Corporation Finance about our registration statements and other filings with a goal to satisfy the collective sentiment of the staff of the various divisions of the SEC that are struggling to find common ground around how best to regulate our industry.\"\n\nRiot shares were down 30 percent Friday around $12.01 at time of publication."
