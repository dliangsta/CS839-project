The pre-sale began Jan. 21. \"It can only be acquired through the Unique Registry of Digital Mining\" according to the website.\n\nThe price of the petro currency, the government said, will be defined according to the price of a barrel of crude oil. With the idea of maintaining the value of the virtual currency, Maduro allocated 5 billion barrels of oil to its support.\n\nThe launch comes as Venezuela continues to grapple with a widening economic crisis that has led to political instability, massive protests and food shortages.\n\n*Maria Paula Trivino contributed with this note from Bogota."
