"JP Morgan has run some numbers on the pros and cons of including cryptocurrency as part of a diversified investment portfolio.\n\nThe verdict? Bitcoin would have improved performance over the past five years -- simply by virtue of its huge price appreciation -- but cryptos still have some serious limitations in providing an effective portfolio hedge.\n\nThe analysis was carried out by John Normand, JP Morgan's Head of Cross-Asset Fundamental Strategy.\n\nNormand began by looking at Bitcoin's price action, which has risen dramatically through huge boom and bust cycles.\n\nTo illustrate, he included this chart which neatly demonstrates how Bitcoin's volatility compares to traditional asset classes:\n\nOn a 12-month basis, Bitcoin's volatility was about 10 times that of stocks and commodities.\n\nSuch uncertainty is reason enough for many investors to stay away all together, but Normand notes that cryptocurrencies shouldn't be ruled out of a diversified portfolio strategy just because they are volatile.\n\nOf more importance is how that volatility correlates to other asset classes, particularly during periods of market stress.\n\nFor example, if strong evidence exists that Bitcoin goes up or holds its value when stocks are falling, then including Bitcoin could improve the portfolio's risk-return characteristics.\n\nAnd on that measure, Bitcoin has shown some limitations. Here's Normand on how it's played out to date (our emphasis added):\n\nIncluding Bitcoin in a multi-asset portfolio did not prevent portfolio drawdown from mid-2015 to early 2016 when US stocks and emerging market were falling, since Bitcoin itself\n\nwas mostly range-bound over this period.\n\nNor did cryptocurrencies offset portfolio losses during periods of acute market stress like the equity flash crashes of August 2015 (S&P500 -11% in a week, Bitcoin -12%) and February 2018 (S&P500 -8% in a week, Bitcoin -45%).\n\nSo based on the price action in recent years, there's no strong evidence indicating Bitcoin will act as a safe portfolio hedge if, say, a sharp rise in inflation causes a more systemic selloff in global equities.\n\nNormand added that despite Bitcoin's huge volatility, its value has rocketed higher over the past five years.\n\nAnd on that basis alone, \"a modest allocation to bitcoin over the past several years would have improved portfolio efficiency on average for a hypothetical multi-asset portfolio\".\n\nHowever, Bitcoin's boom and bust cycles and lack of correlation with other asset classes limits its effectiveness.\n\nLooking longer-term, Normand said even if cryptocurrencies evolve to play a bigger role in the financial system, the returns of the previous five years are unlikely to be repeated.\n\n\"So even if cryptocurrencies represent as much the future of finance as they could represent a financial market bubble (like technology stocks 20 years ago), the possibility of mean reversion in coming years could detract from portfolio efficiency through the return angle.\n\n\"Thus, based on the above, investors are probably best served by hedging their bets -- we believe that any allocation to cryptocurrencies as insurance should not be a portfolio's only hedge.\""
