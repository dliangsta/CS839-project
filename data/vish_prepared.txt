The steady uptick in prices may have prompted by the bullish news that an anonymous trader purchased around 41,000 Bitcoin between Feb. 9 and Feb. 12, worth around $440 mln today, Marketwatch reported. The purchase reportedly brought the BTC address total up to over 96,000 BTC, or little over $1 bln..

Every US dollar or an Indian rupee printed has to be directly proportional to the gold that country has, the value fluctuates with the actual gold value. However, the cryptocurrency is a digital asset, which works independently. Cryptocurrency value depends on people, if people think it has a value, then the price goes higher or vice versa. Hence there are no entities that actually controls these currencies..

The creator of the cryptocurrency can limit the number of tokens or coins. It all depends on the demand. The recent rise and fall of the Bitcoin explain this phenomenon in the simplest way. If more people buy, the prices go up or vice versa..

On February 15, 2018, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) published a customer advisory regarding virtual currency pump-and-dump schemes..
`_ `_______ `__ `____ `__ `________ `______ `______ `_________ `_____ `________ ` `_______ `_______ `________ `______ `_______ `____________ `________ 
"Customers should not purchase virtual currencies, digital coins, or tokens based on social media tips or sudden price spikes," the agency wrote. "Thoroughly research virtual currencies, digital coins, tokens, and the companies or entities behind them in order to separate hype from facts.".
`_________ `_____ `__ `_______ `______ `__________ `______ `_____ `_ `_____ `____ `_ `_____ `____ `___ `_ `_____ `____ `_______ `__ `_____ `_____ `__________ `_______ `______ `__________ `______ `_____ `______ `__ `__ `________ `_ `_______ `_____ `___ `_ `____ `_ `_______ `___ `___ `_______ 
The CFTC noted that this malicious activity has been around for much longer than digital currencies:.
`__ `___ `____ `___ `___ `________ `_______ `__ `___ `_____ `__ `___ `_____ `___ `______ `___________ 
"Historically, they were the domain of 'boiler room' frauds that aggressively peddled penny stocks by falsely promising the companies were on the verge of major breakthroughs, releasing groundbreaking products, or merging with blue chip competitors.".

Now, cryptocurrency pump-and-dump schemes present several challenges to regulators. Exchanges might be located outside of the United States, they may not incorporate know-your-customerprotocols, and the relative anonymity of cryptocurrency can make it difficult to track down bad actors. The speed and global nature of these crimes make them much harder to ..

How cryptocurrency pump-and-dumps typically function?.
`__ `_____________ `_____________ `________ `_________ 
"Some pump and dumps use false news reports, typically about a famous high-tech business leader or investor who plans to pour millions of dollars into a small, lesser known virtual currency or coin. Other fake news stories have featured major retailers, banks, or credit card companies, announcing plans to partner with one virtual currency or another. Links to the phony stories are also accompanied by posts that create false urgency and tell readers to buy now.".

The CFTC's call for caution follows a similar warning from US Securities and Commission chairman Jay Clayton. "It would shock me if you don't see pump-and-dump schemes in the initial coin offering space," said Clayton in September 2017. "This is an area where I'm concerned about what's going to happen to retail investors.".

According to the SEC's orders, there are questions regarding the nature of the companies' business operations and the value of their assets, including in press releases issued beginning in early January 2018.

It's still a few days before that February 20th release. But you can get a headstart by finding a clue in the game website's source code, according to the site's FAQ. To pull up the site's source code, just right-click anywhere on the site and click "View page source." It'll look like a lot of nonsense to anybody who's not familiar with HTML code:.

It's not clear where the clue is hidden: It could be in the source code of either the Home page or FAQ page. The other two clickable links lead you to a press kit download and the Steam product page, so there's no source code to browse through there..

I obviously pulled up the source code of both the Home and FAQ page and lazily searched for "clue," and I was met with a message that's not visible on the regular FAQ page. It reads: "haha you really thought this was going to work?".

LitePay will be one of the biggest developments in cryptocurrency in 2018, with its impact rippling out far beyond Litecoin..
`______ `___ `_ `__ `_ `__ `______ `___________ `_ `_____________ `_ `____ `___ `__ `_____ `_______ `__ `__ `_____ `_________ 
The announcement from LitePay Inc. late Monday (Feb. 12) that the service will go live Feb. 26 was a prime catalyst in pushing the Litecoin price as much as 37% higher over the next few days..
`__ `___________ `___ `______ `___ `___ `_____ `____ `__ `___ `__ `______ `___ `_ `___ `___ `_ `__ ` `____ `_______ `_ `______ `__ `_______ `____ `_ `___ `_ `__ `_____ `___ `__ `___ `__ `_____ 
But even that reaction understates what LitePay will mean for Litecoin and the role cryptocurrencies are destined to play in the global economy..
`__ `___ `___ `_______ `__________ `___ `______ `___ `___ `__ `_______ `__ `__ `___ `_______________ `__ `_______ `_ `___ `_ `__ `_____ `________ 
This is a genuine turning point....
`___ `_ ` `______ `______ `________ 
Basically, LitePay is a way to spend Litecoin just about anywhere you can use a credit or debit card..
`_________ `______ `_ ` `__ `_ `____ `_______ `___ `____ `_______ `__ `__ `__ ` `_____ `_ `____ `_____ 
Customers start by ordering a card from the LitePay website. When the LitePay card arrives in the mail, the customer activates it on the LitePay website and creates a cardholder account. Then the customer transfers the Litecoin they want to spend to that account..
`________ `____ `_ `_______ ` `___ `___ `__ `______ `_______ `___ `__ `______ `___ `______ `_ `__ `____ `__ `_______ `________ `_ `_ `__ `______ `______ `__ `______ ` `_________ `_______ `___ `__ `_______ `________ `__ `_______ `___ `___ `_ `____ `_ `___ `________ 
The LitePay card is linked to that account. When the account is funded, the card is ready to use as you would any other pre-paid credit card..
`__ `______ `___ `_ `_____ `_ `___ `_______ `___ `__ `______ `_ `______ `__ `___ `_ `____ `_ `__ `_ `__ `____ `__ `____ `_______ `_____ `_____ 
And get this - you can use the LitePay card almost anywhere, because it works with the vast Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) network..
`__ `__ `___ ` `__ `__ `__ `__ `______ `___ `_____ `________ `______ `_ `____ `___ `__ `___ `___ `___ `_____ `_ `________ 
When used, the card converts the Litecoin amount to the merchant's local currency. The payment is sent instantly to the merchant's bank from the user's LitePay account. According to the LitePay website, the system is available in 41 countries and works with multiple currencies, including U.S. dollars, euros and British pounds..
`___ `____ `__ `___ `_______ `__ `_______ `_____ `_ `__ `_________ `____ `________ `__ `______ `_ `___ `________ `_ `__ `_________ `___ `___ `__ `_____ `______ `_______ `________ `_ `__ `______ `_______ `__ `_____ `_ `________ `_ `_ `________ `__ `____ `___ `_______ `__________ `________ `___ `_______ `____ `__ `______ `_______ 
LitePay makes it much easier for Litecoin owners to spend their cryptocurrency, but there's a lot for merchants to like as well..

For one thing, LitePay does the currency conversion instantly, removing any risk the merchant would have to account for Litecoin price fluctuations. The instant transfer of money is also appealing, as cryptocurrency payments typically involve delays of several minutes or even hours..
`__ `__ `_____ `______ `___ `__ `_______ `_________ `_________ `_______ `__ `___ `__ `_______ `____ `___ `_ `______ `__ `_______ `____ `____________ `__ `______ `_______ `_ `____ `_ `___ `_________ `_ `_____________ `_______ `________ `______ `_____ `_ `______ `______ `_ `___ `______ 
But best of all, a LitePay transaction carries a fee of just 1% - about half the interchange fee that Visa and Mastercard Inc. (NYSE: MA) charge merchants. That could tempt merchants to encourage the use of LitePay over conventional credit cards..
`__ `___ `_ `___ ` `______ `__________ `______ ` `__ `_ `___ `_ ` `____ `___ `__ `__________ `__ `___ `___ `__ `_________ `___ `_____ `__ `_____ `_________ `___ `____ `____ `________ `_ `________ `__ `__ `_ `______ `___ `___________ `_____ `______

Atari SA -- the shambling corpse holding company that shares a name with the company that made Pong and the Atari 2600 decades ago -- has seen its stock price soar after lending its brand to a couple of ill-defined cryptocurrency efforts..

The French holding company announced last week that it had traded use of its name for a 15 percent stake in Gibraltar-based Infinity Networks, which will create a cryptocurrency-based "Atari Token" platform that could be used to pay for various kinds of "digital entertainment." Atari is also planning to extend its existing partnership with online casino maker Pariplay to create a separate "Pong Token" that will be accepted in "crypto-casinos.".

Despite the lack of details, shares in Atari SA are up 52 percent since the February 8 announcement. That mirrors the market exuberance for similarly vague crypto-related announcements from the likes of Kodak, the Long Island Iced Tea Company, and a Hooters franchise. The excitement seems undampened by the recent plunge in the price of Bitcoin..

If the name Atari Token" sounds familiar, it might be because the firm previously used that name for its own cross-platform reward points system which could be used to fuel in-game microtransactions. The reuse of the name seems coincidental at this point, though it's possible that the old Atari Tokens could be folded into the new Atari Token brand somehow..

A jump onto the cryptocurrency bandwagon isn't shocking for the company now known as Atari, which seems to form the bulk of its business by trading on the nostalgia value of its brand names. The company has loaned out its name for a Linux-based crowdfunded console, an Atari-branded speaker hat, and a line of Internet of Things devices in recent months..

That business extends to stringent legal efforts to protect its brand. Last year, Atari sued over a KitKat ad that was similar to Breakout. The year before, the company opposed a gaming trademark that used the words "Haunted House" because of a 1982 Atari game with the same name. The year before that, Atari threatened legal action against a game that resembled Tempest..

After asking the audience who has heard of Bitcoin to applause, and then asking who can explain what Bitcoin is, Degeneres answered her own question:.
`____ `_____ `__ `_______ `__ `__ `____ `_ `______ `_ `________ `__ `___ `_____ `__ `__ `______ `___ `______ `__ `________ `_______ `__ `__ `_________ 
"Nobody knows how it works. Nobody. Everybody's talking about Bitcoin and nobody understands it. It's like a plot twist in a confusing movie.".
`______ `____ `__ `_ `_____ `______ `__________ `______ `____ `______ `__ `_____ `__________ `__ `___ `___ ` `___ `____ `_ ` `________ `_______ 
While her comparison of Bitcoin's digital nature as similar to that of a picture of a cute goat that only exists online doesn't fully transmit a solid understanding of cryptocurrency, Degeneres does correctly explain that BTC works "sort of like the stock market" and that one can store their Bitcoin in a digital wallet that can either be off or online..

Due to the recent market volatility that brought Bitcoin's price up to $20,000 in December and below $7000 in February -- not quite the "$20,000 or nothing" that Degeneres says -- she sees Bitcoin as a "digital Antiques Roadshow" that can make you either "a millionaire or totally broke.".

A lack of consumer understanding of cryptocurrencies is often cited as the reason more government regulation is needed.

South Korea has quickly become a critical region for all cryptocurrencies. Any local exchange is of great interest to both Korean and international traders. When companies such as Upbit add a new coin to be traded, there will be a genuine interest in it. In the case of 0x, it will be interesting to see how it performs in South Korea. The addition of XRZ to Upbit may herald a new era for this project as a whole..

South Korea has become the new China for alternative cryptocurrencies. More specifically, it was very important for altcoins to get listed on Chinese exchanges in the past. Such developments often resulted in major price gains and overall positive momentum. Ever since China became a trivial cog in the cryptocurrency machine, South Korea has taken its place. Any currency listed on Korean exchanges is worth keeping an eye on. Upbit, the country's second-largest exchange, is adding new coins on a rather regular basis right now..

Their latest addition comes in the form of ZRX, the native token of the 0x protocol. It is an interesting choice, for many different reasons. A lot of people consider 0x to be the cryptocurrency-related protocol worth keeping an eye on. This decentralized exchange framework is of great interest to a lot of traders. Slowly but surely, the industry is moving to decentralized exchanges rather than centralized counterparts. Even so, companies such as Upbit will always have a place in the world of cryptocurrency exchanges..

With the Korean exchange now listing 0x as a trading market, an interesting situation is created. It seems the company lists all tokens traded on the Bittrex exchange. More specifically, 0x was added to Bittrex yesterday. Not long after, Upbit does exactly the same. An interesting correlation between both companies. It does appear the volume for both exchanges is picking up as a result of this addition. On Upbit, 0x has generated over $12.1m in volume over the past 24 hours. Bittrex generates a nearly identical volume as of right now..

With these exchanges supporting 0x, the price is also on the rise. Many speculators consider exchange listings to be good for the price overall. More liquidity in the market is never a bad thing either. If Upbit can generate a decent trading volume, things will start looking good for ZRX. Getting listed on Korea's second-largest exchange is no small feat. For now, it remains to be seen what type of impact this news will have..

Orca, an easy-to-use, intelligent BOS based in Singapore and Malaysia, is used in food and beverage (F&B) businesses across eight countries. By connecting various modules and solutions, Orca promotes a seamless flow of information to provide accurate and timely data to improve operations. BOS is a collection of business processes to boost the efficiency of each function of one's business. It includes the fundamental framework, policies and routines needed to operate and grow a business. Orca also has many Point of Sale (POS) systems in Malaysia and Singapore..

Puregold will provide free payment machines and tablets that properly include the POS system to merchants, and manage promotion for the payment gateway, using ICO funding. This will put Puregold in a strategic position to acquire merchants in Asia. Puregold is working with COSS Exchange in managing the ICO marketing and listing, and talks have also started regarding a potential future cooperation when it comes to POS/payment gateway solutions..

Advantages of payments in gold: A win-win situation.

When the price of gold increases, the payer can make use of the increase in value to make payments when buying products, and then does not need to pay a transaction fee as the exchange rate of gold versus currency is at 'spot price,' (the current market price at which an asset is bought or sold for immediate payment and delivery)..

The payee, on the other hand, pays a transaction fee of 1%. This is akin to purchasing gold at 1% above spot price, which is extremely attractive..

On Thursday, the grandfather of all cryptocurrencies managed to pass the $10,200 price point, bucking a downward trend on-going since December. At the time of writing this article, the price was sitting at $10,009 per coin. Despite what the doom sayers have been espousing, it doesn't look like this cryptocurrency is going to become worthless any time soon..

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies saw a downward shift in their prices after January 6th, having previously fell slightly in the last half of December. By February 6th, bitcoin had reached its lowest point of $6,300 but has recovered remarkably well in the nine days since despite gloomy press coverage and a bitcoin purchasing ban imposed by Lloyds Banking Group on its credit card customers. The upward trend effectively ends what came to be known by bulls as the "January Sales"..

This year should see some bottlenecks in the bitcoin network become resolved. One of the main issues plaguing bitcoin right now is the cost of transfer fees which are easily reaching $10 or more; such fees will likely be decimated as more exchanges and wallets such as Coinbase start migrating to SegWit. Going on from there, work to implement something called the 'Lightning Network' is happening but that may not see widespread use this year; once adopted should bring any remaining transfer fees down to almost nil..

Last November, the price of bitcoin crossed the $10,000 level for the first time. The rest of 2017 was an explosive ride, shooting up near $20,000 per coin before closing out the year just above $13,400..

In this environment, this week, "bitcoin $10,000" has taken on meaning unlike what we saw last year. If we could see the coin hold this level significantly, then it will start the next wave higher, attracting fresh capital into the market after the recent massive sell-off..

Browsealoud will be offline until 15 February to beef up security, the firms behind the code, Texthelp Ltd, said on its website. The online hijackings show the lengths to which some people will go to stockpile Monero -- a so-called privacy coin that, once obtained, is particularly hard for authorities to trace. After a 20-fold surge in price over the past year to about $275 per coin, Monero now ranks 13th among cryptocurrencies with a market value of $4.3 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.com..

About 630 of the top 300,000 websites tracked by Amazon.com Inc.'s Alexa Internet unit have mining code embedded in them, researcher 360 Netlab estimated on 7 February. This week, Kaspersky Lab warned some users of Telegram messaging app also have been mining coins, while Malwarebytes Labs said millions of Android devices are currently mining Monero. Monero mining is spreading as -- unlike most coins -- it can be produced with a typical device most people already own. Bloomberg.

The comments by CFTC chairman J.

`________ `___ `________ `_ `_______ `___ `______ `_________ `_____ `________ `____ `_ `_ `_________ `________ `____ `_ `_ `____ 
"Any proposed Federal regulation of virtual currency platforms should be carefully tailored to the risks posed by relevant trading activity and enhancing efforts to prosecute fraud and manipulation.

The comments come after Giancarlo - who arguably won over segments of the cryptocurrency community by declaring that, without bitcoin, "there would be no distributed ledger technology" - urged for a balanced approach to regulation when speaking before the Senate committee last week..

South Korea appeared to soften its attitude toward cryptocurrencies this week, with one report suggesting that the government is looking at the possibility of a cryptocurrency exchange licensing system. The licensing system could be similar to that of New York's "BitLicense" system, which provides firms handling virtual currencies a license to operate, according to the report..

The cryptocurrency market recovery continued on Thursday, with nearly every top 100-cryptocurrency rising in value against the US dollar. The Bitcoin price headlined the advance, testing the $10,000 for the first time since Feb. 1. Ripple, meanwhile, surged on the surprising news that money transfer behemoth Western Union is trialing XRP integration in a pilot program..

The rally briefly raised the cryptocurrency market cap above $475 billion, which constituted a two-week high, although it has since ebbed back to a present value of $471.6 billion..

Bitcoin continued to defy its critics on Thursday, posting a six percent advance and raising its price within striking distance of $10,000 for the first time since the beginning of February. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has thus far been able to break through that barrier and it is now trading at $9,860 after rising as high as $9,946 earlier in the day. Bitcoin now has a market cap of $166.8 billion, which has enabled its market share to tick up to 35.3 percent..

The Ethereum price joined Bitcoin in its rally, although its advance could not quite keep pace with that of its older sister. At present, Ethereum is trading at $935 on Bitfinex, representing a 24-hour increase of about four percent. This provides Ethereum with a market cap of $91.8 billion, which translates into a 19.5 percent market share..

Litecoin, ranked fifth, extended its surge by another six percent, bringing its price to $220 and market cap to $12.1 billion. Cardano, its closest competitor, rose by four percent but still lost ground in its quest to reclaim the fifth spot in the rankings..

Eighth-ranked NEO rose by three percent to $122, although it was not enough to raise its market cap above the $8 billion mark. The EOS price rose three percent to crack the $10 threshold, and IOTA rounded out the top 10 with a four percent increase to $2.05..

That could explain why USA Luge, the team of ice luge athletes currently representing the United States at the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, was not afraid to ask for Bitcoin donations in the lead-up to this year's Olympics. In December, USA Luge started accepting Bitcoin (BTC) donations as part of the team's fundraising efforts to support U.S. Olympic luge athletes in their training and travel to the Winter Games in South Korea..

In a Medium post from December, titled "USA Luge Team Running on Bitcoin," the team wrote that Bitcoin investors and "lugers" share some similarities, because "both know all about speed, crashes, risk management, and holding on. Which is maybe why the US Luge Team and Bitcoin are made for each other.".

"We've looked at bitcoin hard, and it is definitely a risk-reward we understand and are eager to take," Gordy Sheer, USA Luge's marketing director and a 1998 silver medalist in luge doubles, said in a statement in December. CNET reported that the team promised supporters to offer luge team hats featuring the Bitcoin logo if they reach their fundraising goals..

As CNET reported, the team received Bitcoin donations amounting to 0.673 BTC, which is the equivalent of roughly $6,200. The team had asked its supporters to hit a funding goal of five BTC (or almost $50,000). However, USA Luge "is not thinking short term," as former Olympian luge competitor Ty Danco (who donated cryptocurrency to the team) said the team plans to hold its Bitcoin donations through the 2022 and 2026 Winter Games in a bet on the cryptocurrency's long-term viability..

The U.S. luge relay team finished just off the podium on Thursday, coming in fourth behind the teams from Germany, Canada, and Austria..

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on Thursday issued a warning about cryptocurrency pump-and-dump schemes..
`__ `________ `______ `______ `_________ `_____ `_ `_______ `_____ ` `______ `____ `_____________ `____________ `________ 
The release, published Thursday, marks the latest investor warning from the U.S. commodities and derivatives regulator. Earlier this month, the agency put out an advisory that urged caution around investing in cryptocurrency retirement accounts..

`____ `__________ `_____ `__ `_________ `__ `_______ `__________ `___ `___ `______ `__ `____ `_ `____________ `_______ `___________ `_____ `______ `___ `________ `_______ 
The latest advisory focuses in part on a key avenue for cryptocurrency promotion: social media. It's a notable topic, given that major platforms such as Facebook have moved to ban advertisements for cryptocurrencies and ICOs amid a spate of such marketing pushes..
`__ `_____ `_______ `______ `_ `___ `_ ` `__ `_____ `__ `_____________ `_________ `_____ `_____ `___ ` `______ `_____ `____ `___ `____ `________ `___ `_ `_______ `___ `____ `_ `__ `_____________ `__ `_______________ `__ `___ `___ ` `____ `_ `___ `________ `_______ 
In its statement, the agency said that investors should do their research before potentially buying a cryptocurrency..
`_ `__ `_________ `__ `_____ `___ `___ `________ `_____ `_ `____ `_______ `_____ `__________ `_____ ` `_______________ 
"Customers should not purchase virtual currencies, digital coins, or tokens based on social media tips or sudden price spikes. Thoroughly research virtual currencies, digital coins, tokens, and the companies or entities behind them in order to separate hype from facts," it wrote..

Describing the environment as "old scam, new technology," the CFTC warned that "same basic fraud is now occurring using little known virtual currencies and digital coins or tokens.".
`_________ `__ `__________ `_ `___ `____ `__ `___________ `__ `___ `_____ `___ `____ `____ `____ `_ `__ `________ `____ `_____ `____ `______ `_________ `__ `______ `____ `_ `________ 
The agency also detailed some of the methods by which the pump groups manipulate members to drive prices - often to the benefit of the organizers themselves..
`__ `_____ `___ `_______ `___ `_ `__ `______ `_ `____ `__ `___ `_____ `_________ `______ `_ `____ `_____ ` `____ `_ `__ `______ `_ `__ `_________ `___________ 
The CFTC wrote:.
`__ `___ `______ 
"Some pump and dumps use false news reports, typically about a famous high-tech business leader or investor who plans to pour millions of dollars into a small, lesser known virtual currency or coin. Other fake news stories have featured major retailers, banks, or credit card companies, announcing plans to partner with one virtual currency or another. Links to the phony stories are also accompanied by posts that create false urgency and tell readers to buy now.".

The CFTC also hinted that it could seek enforcement actions against those who organize such groups..
`__ `___ `___ `_____ `___ `_ `____ `___ `__________ `______ `______ `____ `__ `_______ `___ `_______ 
"While its regulatory oversight authority over commodity cash markets is limited, the CFTC maintains general anti-fraud and manipulation enforcement authority over virtual currency cash markets as a commodity in interstate commerce.".

We all know what time of the year Easter comes around on, but unlike other Christian holidays such as Christmas, there is no set date for Easter Sunday..

`_______ `_ `_ ` `_____ `__________ `__________ `____ `__ `_____ `_____ `_ `___ `_______ `______ `____ `_ `__ `____ `___ 
How is the date of Easter Sunday decided?.
`__ `_ `__ `___ `_ `_____ `_____ `________ 
Easter Sunday falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon occurring on or after the March equinox..
`_____ `_____ `____ `_ `__ `____ `_____ `____ `__ `____ `___ `___ `________ `_ `_ `____ `__ `____ `________ 
The March (or Spring) equinox is the moment the Sun crosses the celestial equator from south to north and falls on March 19, 20 or 21 each year..

Easter Sunday celebrates the resurrection of Jesus after his death, but no set date of this is mentioned in the Bible..
`_____ `_____ `_________ `__ `___________ `_ `____ `____ `__ `_____ `__ `_ `__ `___ `_ `___ `_ `________ `_ `__ `______ 
It is said that Jesus' death, and subsequent resurrection, happened around the Jewish Passover, which is celebrated on the Paschal Moon each year..

Gamers are having a hard item finding a GPU for their gaming rigs as prices are soaring due to demand from cryptocurrency miners. Reuters is reporting that the NVIDIA GeForce 1070 GPU was selling for $349 a year ago and is now being sold on Amazon for up to $900 by resellers due to the demand for the graphics card and the low inventory..

NVIDIA stock climbed 6% in early trading last week after 14 different Wall Street brokerages raised price targets on the NVIDIA stock because of their confidence in the sector. Normally gamers use the video cards for playing video games, but hardware has been popular with the cryptocurrency mining set, eating up inventory and driving prices up..

NVIDIA's CFO said recently in a conference call that inventory levels for gaming GPUs were at a historic low level due to cryptocurrency miners. "We do think that cryptocurrency has been a very significant factor in both revenue and pricing, creating a shortage environment that is boosting pricing," Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said..

NVIDIA is expected to see its competitive advantage grow even more when it launches its Volta chip architecture in gaming chips later in the year. Another new GPU codenamed Turing is expected to launch next month. The company has seen its gaming revenue grow 29% to $1.74 billion in Q4 making up more than half the company's revenue..

Cryptocurrencies are a bad store of value and a bad unit of account. As such, they're a bad form of money..
`_______________ `__ ` `__ `____ `_ `____ `__ ` `__ `___ `_ `_______ `_ `____ `______ ` `__ `___ `_ `______ 
JPMorgan made that case in a wide-ranging note on cryptocurrencies sent out to clients on Friday. While the bank said it may make sense for some investors to include digital currencies in their portfolios as a hedge, it doesn't view any cryptocurrency as a "legitimate competitor" to sovereign currencies..

"The huge volatility of the price of cryptocurrencies-with respect to either traditional currencies or to a basket of goods and services-has made use of cryptocurrencies as a unit of account impractical," the bank said. "Only hobbyists are using cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange, at least for conventional transactions for goods and services.".

This point has been made by some of the most notable Wall Streeters, including Bridgewater's Ray Dalio and OakTree Capital's Howard Marks. But JPMorgan goes one step further. The bank notes that even if a cryptocurrency were to meet the criteria of a currency, it still would have a very difficult time giving a national currency a run for its money because of the network effect of fiat. Here's the bank's reasoning (emphasis their own):.

"At any rate, even a hypothetically stable-value cryptocurrency is unlikely to compete with the dollar for transactions in goods and services, in say, Chicago, or to compete with the euro in Stuttgart. Economists have long viewed successful, i.e. relatively price-stable, currencies as natural monopolies in a given geographic area. This particular natural monopoly arises as a result of the inherent network externalities: pricing a New York meal in yen makes little sense as almost all customers will be holding dollars.".

The bank's argument echoes that of its chief executive Jamie Dimon, who in September 2017 famously called bitcoin "a fraud." The billionaire banker, who has since stepped away from those comments, also once said bitcoin is only useful for criminals and "a kind of novelty.".

LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - The number of hedge funds focused on trading cryptocurrencies more than doubled in the four months to Feb. 15, despite sharp falls in the value of the virtual coins in recent weeks, data from fintech research house Autonomous NEXT showed on Thursday..

The firm recorded a record high of 226 global hedge funds with such a strategy, up from 110 global hedge funds as of Oct. 18. That itself was up from 55 funds at Aug. 29 and just 37 at the start of 2017..

The surge in funds comes at a volatile time for the cryptocurrencies they trade in. After hitting a record high close to $20,000 in December, bitcoin lost 70 percent of its value to slip below $6,000 in January, posting its worst monthly performance in three years..

RBI has reportedly warned banks about cryptocurrencies in January, telling them to step up scrutiny of financial transactions by companies and exchanges involved in the trade of bitcoins and similar digital tender. However, the apex bank is yet to declare such transactions illegal. The central bank's has asked banks to understand how these currencies work before dealing with such companies. Besides, the RBI has also been periodically issuing notifications cautioning various stakeholders regarding the risks of virtual currencies..

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Budget 2018 speech said that 'government does not consider crypto-currencies legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system'. At the same time, Jaitley did not declare cryptocurrencies illegal. Therefore, the legal status of cryptocurrencies continues to be in a limbo..

Globally, banks and other financial institutions are seen taking precautionary measures since cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and customers who purchase these virtual currencies using their credit cards may not be able to clear their dues if they are hit hard by a price crash. In the US, Citigroup and others like Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase have blocked cryptocurrency purchases via credit cards as they are are not willing to take the credit risk associated with it. And in the UK, Llyod Bank has banned customers from buying bitcoins using credit cards..

Bitcoin is up 3.6% against the dollar to $9,825.91 at 7.55 a.m. GMT (2.55 a.m. ET). As the chart at the top shows, bitcoin slumped at the start of February but has been picking up again over the last week or so. It still remains far off its all-time highs of over $19,000 reached just before Christmas..

Bitcoin today remains the largest digital currency by market cap, and is now trading at $9,160 at the time of writing. That's up more than 50% from its trough just below $6,000 on February 6.

Shares of Bitcoin Investment Trust (NASDAQOTH:GBTC) are up about 13% as of 2:45 p.m. EST. The cryptocurrency rallied in early trading today, so investors eager to hop on board are driving the trust's stock price up higher and faster than the value of the bitcoin it owns..

Each share of Bitcoin Investment Trust represents ownership of approximately 0.001 bitcoin, thus one must own approximately 1,000 shares to effectively control one bitcoin. At the current market price of $16.28 per share, Bitcoin Investment Trust implies a market value of roughly $16,163 per bitcoin..

On digital currency exchanges, bitcoin trades at a lower price -- for approximately $9,274 each on GDAX. Bitcoin prices on GDAX are up about 6.5% from when the stock market closed on Tuesday, while Bitcoin Investment Trust is up about 13% over the same period. The differential is due to the trust's premium, which is expanding today..

I estimate the Bitcoin Investment Trust currently trades at a price about 75% higher than the value of the bitcoin it owns on behalf of its shareholders. Investors have long been willing to pay a high price for the convenience of speculating on bitcoin with their brokerage accounts rather than simply buying the cryptocurrency on online exchanges, though the premium ebbs and flows with speculative interest in the cryptocurrency..

Where bitcoin and Bitcoin Investment Trust will trade from here is anyone's guess, as they frequently trade in different directions. The trust's share price declined by more than 3% yesterday, despite the fact that the bitcoin it holds appreciated by more than 1%, for example..

The trust's premium is reaching rare territory today. Based on historical prices, Bitcoin Investment Trust trades at a premium of 70% or higher on only about 20% of trading days. So far in 2018, shares of Bitcoin Investment Trust have only closed at a premium of 75% or more on just three trading days..

This threshold is backed closely by a Fibonacci confluence at 222/25- a close above this level is needed to validate a breakout of the broader descending formation with such a scenario targeting 260 and the 61.08% retracement at 298..

Near-term bullish invalidation now raised to the yearly low-day close at 130- a break below this level would risk significant losses for Litecoin prices with such a scenario targeting a drop towards confluence support at 116 where the 200-day moving average converges on the 78.6% retracement and basic slope support. Bottom line: prices are testing downtrend resistance and we're looking for a reaction. From a trading standpoint, I'll favor longs while above the monthly open..

News earlier this month that a group of developers are planning to hard fork the Litecoin network for the first time to form "Litecoin Cash" on Feb. 19, 2017 sparked enthusiasm amongst traders. Price increases are also attributable to traders likely 'stocking up' on LTC in order to benefit from the forthcoming 'airdrop' of Litecoin Cash tokens..

PSA: The Litecoin team and I are not forking Litecoin. Any forks that you hear about is a scam trying to confuse you to think it's related to Litecoin. Don't fall for it and definitely don't enter your private keys or seed into their website or client. Be careful out there! https://t.co/qXbiIxp5Al -- Charlie Lee [LTC] (@SatoshiLite).

Roubini claims that he had received death threats as a result of those views, adding that he anticipated another attack, and had received recent threats. "In 2015, when I criticized bitcoin, on top of death threats, they did a denial-of-service attack against my 50 folks consulting biz website & shut it down for a day. I expect to be hacked again, as I have been warned. Terrorists!" the pessimistic oracle posted on his Twitter..

Over the course of the past week, the Bitcoin price had established a base at $8,000, seemingly bringing an end to a market free-fall that had seen BTC and other top cryptocurrencies sink to their lowest levels since November. However, Bitcoin met strong resistance at $9,000, and despite briefly piercing its armor, it had proved unable to break through that sell wall..

Earlier this morning, though, the Bitcoin price punched through $9,000 and continued to climb, peaking at $9,300 on Bitfinex at approximately 1:30 PM UTC. At present, the Bitcoin price is trading at $9,245, which translates into a $156.7 billion market cap..

The largest share of BTC volume is located on cryptocurrency exchange OKEx, which currently boasts four of Bitcoin's 10 highest-volume trading pairs. This heavy concentration of volume on OKEx is likely linked to the news that the Hong Kong-based exchange is launching its own utility token, OKB, and is distributing a combined 100 million tokens to traders who achieve at least 5 BTC worth of volume between Feb. 10 and Feb. 14..

`_ `___ `___ `______ `_________ `___ `_ `_________ `________ `_ `__ `___ `_ `__ `__________ `_____________ `______ `___ `_____________ 
The majority of cryptocurrencies can't be used as transactional currency, and they are being traded like assets, according to the CEO. Ripple and the company behind it are arguably the most criticized digital assets, as the whole idea of bitcoin as the first cryptocurrency was that it should not be regulated..

Ripple peaked $3.31 in January and fell to around $1.00 this week. The idea of the token is to act as a bridge between international bank transactions, not to become the alternative for fiat currencies. The majority of ripple tokens are held by the parent company, meaning that it can regulate their price..

Garlinghouse said he believes the best way of using cryptocurrency is to "work within the system," not become an opposition to government regulation and traditional financial institutions..
`___________ `___ `_ `_______ `__ `___ `__ `_ `____ `_____________ `_ `_ `____ `_____ `__ `_______ `__ `_____ `_ `_________ `_ `_________ `_________ `__ `__________ `________ `_____________ 
He also gave a nod to the idea that bitcoin -- which he says is 1,000 times slower and more expensive than XRP -- will still be used as a store of value, similar to the role that gold has played. But it won't be used for payments, in Garlinghouse's opinion..

NEW YORK, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Less than 100 people out of the 250,000 individuals who have already filed federal taxes this year through company Credit Karma reported a cryptocurrency transaction to U.S. tax authorities, the company said on Tuesday..

This is despite nearly 57 percent of the 2000 Americans surveyed by the credit score startup and research firm Qualtrics last month saying they had realized some gains from cryptocurrencies, according to a Credit Karma study..

Trading of cryptocurrencies, digital tokens whose value is not backed by central banks and hard assets, surged in 2017 amid a rally in their price. A single bitcoin is worth more than $8000, compared with $1000 a year ago..

Despite the surge it remains unclear how many Americans hold cryptocurrencies as these are bought and sold on online platforms, sometimes anonymously or using pseudonyms. US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase says it has 10 million users, although it is unclear how many of these are in the U.S..

Ethereum Price Prediction: Why ETH Is the Best Cryptocurrency in 2018.
`_______ `____ `__________ `__ `__ `_ `__ `___ `_____________ `_ `____ 
The recent cryptocurrency crash has bolstered our faith in Ethereum. Ethereum is one cryptocurrency that proved its mettle, while most others, including crypto heavyweight Bitcoin, faltered. Ethereum "Casper," the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), and Ethereum applications are some of its strengths that we'll discuss in our upbeat Ethereum price forecast 2018. So stay with us..

Anyone thinking of investing in Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency should be very careful - their values are volatile, with the ability to plummet as quickly as they shoot up..

CRYPTOCURRENCIES have become popular in recent months with investors trying their luck at making some cash..

Dash is similar to Litecoin in that it was created to improve on the weakness of the bitcoin network..

The developers of this currency created the world's first self-funding and self-governed blockchain protocol..
`__ `_________ `_ `___ `_______ `______ `__ `______ `____ `___________ `__ `____________ `_________ `_________ 
This refers to a peer-to-peer cryptocurency that uses a two-tier network, rather than a single-tier..
`___ `_____ `_ ` `___________ `____________ `___ `___ ` `_______ `_______ `_____ `___ ` `____________ 
This network is achieved through an incentive based system where 10 per cent of each block portion is allocated back to Dash developers who get payments for contributions..

Features include something called "InstantSend" which is instantaneous in a transfer, and "PrivateSend" which keeps the user to be anonymous..

In mid January the price was hovering between $790 and $822..

In November, when it was less popular, the value was $260 a coin..

It appears that there are many sites online which offer to help people buy Dash..

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Less than 100 people out of the 250,000 individuals who have already filed federal taxes this year through company Credit Karma reported a cryptocurrency transaction to U.S. tax authorities, the company said on Tuesday..

This is despite nearly 57 percent of the 2000 Americans surveyed by the credit score startup and research firm Qualtrics last month saying they had realized some gains from cryptocurrencies, according to a Credit Karma study..

The IRS considers cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as property for federal tax purposes, meaning any profits or losses from the sale or exchange of the virtual coins should generally be reported as capital gains or losses..

Trading of cryptocurrencies, digital tokens whose value is not backed by central banks and hard assets, surged in 2017 amid a rally in their price. A single bitcoin is worth more than $8000, compared with $1000 a year ago..

Despite the surge it remains unclear how many Americans hold cryptocurrencies as these are bought and sold on online platforms, sometimes anonymously or using pseudonyms. US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase says it has 10 million users, although it is unclear how many of these are in the U.S..

The highest Bitcoin price of $8,742.42 was recorded in India today on CoinDesks's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Bitcoin touched a high of $8,973.12 a day before. However, it's a long way down from the high of $19,783 it touched on December 17 last year..

The highest Bitcoin price of $8,742.42 was recorded in India today on CoinDesks's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Bitcoin touched a high of $8,973.12 a day before. However, it's a long way down from the high of $19,783 it touched on December 17 last year. Cryptocurrency experts claim that it will take time for Bitcoin to match the record highs that the virtual currency touched in the second half of the last year. Bitcoin was at six-day highs over the weekend recording its price at $9,000. However, just after it declined to go below $8,000 briefly on Sunday only to take a climb once again. Bitcoin's price is over 40 percent above last week's low of $5,947.40..

Forbes, the popular American business magazine, last week came out with a list of Bitcoin millionaires. It was the first of its kind ever and got the heads talking in real sense. Cryptocurrencies especially Bitcoin received further shot in the arm after South Korean Prime Minister last week announced that cryptocurrencies wouldn't be in any danger of being shut down, provided they go by the rules..

Bitcoin was traded aggressively last year, all across the world. Even Indian investors invested huge sums in the digital currency. This resulted in the virtual currency almost touching a record figure of $20,000. However, it was soon followed by a nearly 30 percent plunge which resulted in millions of dollars getting eroded in worth all across the world..

In budget 2018, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced that cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin are not a legal tender. This announcement impacted the cryptocurrency in such a way that exchange servers were said to have come to a halt for the following two days, as a result of this sudden spurt in transactions. However, platforms themselves said that things settled down after the initial panic..

Just weeks back, Nouriel Roubini, the man who rightly predicted the housing crash in US way back in 2008 termed Bitcoin as mother of all bubbles that will burst anytime soon. He even compared it to Mississippi bubble, tech bubble, and Tulip mania. He also predicted that the popular digital currency is on its way down to zero since it lacks any fundamental value..

Verisign released its latest report of the top trending keywords in new .com domain name registrations, and something is noticeably absent for January: cryptocurrency terms..
`_______ `_______ `__ `_____ `_____ `_ `__ `__ `_______ `_______ `_ `__ `___ `_____ `___ `_____________ `__ `________ `_ `_________ `_____ `__ `_______ `_____________ `______ 
For months, domain names including terms such as coin and crypto have been on the trending list. But this month none of the top ten spots include these terms..
`__ `______ `_____ `____ `________ `____ `___ `_ `___ `__ `_____ `___ `___ `_ `__ `_______ `____ `__ `___ `____ `___ `_ `__ `__ `__ `____ `______ `____ `______ 
There are a couple possible reasons for this..
`____ `__ ` `_____ `_______ `______ `__ `_____ 
First, the trending terms list looks at the percentage month-over-month increase in domains registered that contain the word. It's harder to grow percentage-wise as the base gets bigger..
`_____ `__ `_______ `____ `___ `____ `_ `__ `_________ `_______________ `_______ `_ `______ `_________ `___ `______ `__ `____ `___ `_____ `_ `___ `______________ `_ `__ `___ `___ `_______

`______ `_____________ `_____ `____ `___ `___ `______ `_____ `_____ 
You might also argue that interest in cryptocurrencies is starting to wane with price drops, but I wouldn't write that on a blog like this and have crypto bettors fill up the comments with hate comments..

SAN FRANCISCO -- Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse may be the man behind the popular cryptocurrency XRP, but that doesn't mean he has faith that every single token will survive..
`__ `________ `_ `_____ `__ `___ `___________ `__ `_ `__ `__ `_____ `__ `______ `_____________ `___ `__ `___ `______ `___ `_ `__ `____ `___ `____ `_____ `____ `___ `________ 
Speaking to an audience of analysts at the Goldman Sachs' Technology and Internet Conference on Tuesday, Garlinghouse said he believes "most" cryptocurrencies will eventually lose all of their value. In short, he believes that most of these coins are simply not very useful as a transactional currency, meaning there's no reason for them to exist..
`_______ `_ `_ `_______ `_ `_______ `_ `__ `______ `_____ `_________ `__ `_______ `_________ `_ `_______ `___________ `___ `_ `_______ `_____ `_______________ `___ `_________ `___ `__ `_ `____ `_____ `_ `_____ `_ `_______ `___ `___ `_ `____ `____ `__ `_____ `__ `___ `_____ `_ ` `____________ `________ `______ `______ `_ `_____ `__ `___ `_ `______ 
"It's not clear what the use case is. It's not clear the what value proposition is," he told the audience. "Long term value will be dictated by the utility of that asset.".
`____ `__ `____ `___ `__ `__ `___ `__ `___ `__ `____ `__ `___ `____ `__________ `___ `_ `___ `__ `________ `____ `___ `____ `___ `_ `_______ `_ `__ `______ `_ `___ `_______ 
XRP, which peaked $3.31 in January before falling to $0.99 at the time of writing, has caught the eye of investors because of its use within the Ripple payments system. Essentially, XRP is a token very specifically intended for doing fast and low-cost international transactions between banks. To Garlinghouse's point, that is the purpose of XRP..
`___ `____ `_____ `____ `_ `______ `_____ `______ `_ `____ `_ `__ `___ `_ `_______ `__ `_____ `__ `__ `_ `________ `______ `_ `__ `__ `_____ `__ `_____ `_______ `______ `___________ `__ `_ ` `____ `___ `___________ `_______ `__ `____ `___ `__ `_______ `____________ `___________ `______ `_____ `_ `_____________ `_____ `___ `_ `__ `______ `_ `____ 
XRP holds the third highest market cap of any cryptocurrency, at $40.1 billion. Still, some have criticized Ripple for holding the majority of XRP in company reserves, thus giving the company more influence over the price of the coin. This is in contrast to bitcoin, where inflation is determined by the rate at which "miners" generate new coins..
`__ `____ `__ `____ `______ `_____ `__ `_ `__ `______________ `_ `____ `_______ `_____ `___ `___ `_________ `_____ `__ `______ `__ `_______ `_ `__ `_ `______ `________ `___ `_____ `__ `______ `___ `________ `___ `__ `____ `_ `__ `____ `___ `_ `_ `_______ `_ `_______ `____ `________ `_ `_________ `_ `__ `___ `_ `____ `_______ `_______ `__ `______ 
Though Garlinghouse's stance may seem rigid for someone whose company has come into prominence thanks to the recent crypto-craze, he hasn't written off all digital currencies..
`_____ `_____________ `_____ `__ `___ `____ `__ `______ `____ `______ `__ `___ `___ `_________ `_____ `_ `__ `_____ `____________ `_ `_____ `______ `__ `__ `______ `___________ 
Garlinghouse gave nod to the idea that bitcoin -- which he says is 1000 times slower and more expensive than XRP -- will still be used as a store of value, similar to the role that gold has played for . But it won't be used for payments, in his opinion..
`___________ `___ `__ `_ `__ `___ `___ `______ `_ `____ `_ `___ `_ `___ `____ `_____ `__ `___ `________ `___ `__ `_ `___ `____ `_ `___ `_ ` `____ `_ `_____ `______ `_ `__ `___ `___ `___ `__ `_____ `__ ` `__ `_ `____ `_ `___ `__ `________ `_ `__ `________ 
"Bitcoin is going to solve a different problem," he said..

The crypto market continues to struggle today, but many of the top ten cryptocurrencies are just on the cusp of being up rather than down. Cardano (ADA) and Litecoin (LTC) are included here, each altcoin with less than a 1% loss at the moment..
`__ `_____ `_____ `________ `_ `_______ `_____ `__ `___ `_ `__ `__ `__ `_______________ `__ `___ `_ `__ `___ `_ `____ `_ `_____ `___ `____ `______ `____ `__ `_______ `____ `__ `_______ `____ `___ `______ `___ `___ `___ ` `_ `___ `_ `__ `_______ 
There are a number of reasons why the crypto market might be down today. First, several more warnings against crypto were released recently, including Thailand restricting its banks from being involved in crypto anything and the European Supervisory Authorities adding their two cents in about the risks of crypto trading..
`____ `__ ` `_____ `_ `______ `__ `__ `_____ `_____ `____ `_ `___ `_____ `_____ `______ `___ `_______ `______ `_____ `___ `_______ `________ `________ `_______ `__________ `__ `____ `___ `____ `_______ `_ `_____ `_______ `__ `__ `_______ `__________ `__________ `_____ `____ `__ `____ `_ `____ `__ `____ `_ `_____ `________ 
A lot of the time when either of the two big cryptos, Bitcoin and Ethereum, are down, as is the case right now, many altcoins follow suit. The reason behind this correlation might be as simple as people noticing that Bitcoin or Ethereum are down, so they want in while the door is open. Holders of altcoins might trade away their tokens to get a piece of either Bitcoin or Ethereum while they're down. This, in turn, would cause altcoin prices to decrease. This isn't necessarily what is happening currently, but it is a potential explanation..
` `__ `_ `__ `___ `___ `_____ `_ `__ `__ `__ `_______ `______ `__ `________ `__ `____ `_ `_ `__ `___ `____ `___ `___ `_______ `_____ `____ `__ `_____ `_____ `___ `__________ `____ `_ `_ `_____ `_ `_____ `_______ `___ `______ `_ `_______ `__ `____ `_ `___ `___ `_ `____ `__ `___ `_ `____ `______ `_ `_______ `____ `____ `___ `____ `_____ `_ `__ ` `____ `_ `_____ `______ `_ `_______ `____ `______ `____ `____ `_ `____ `____ `____ `______ `_____ `_ `________ `___ `____ `__________ `___ `_ `________ `_________ `__ `_ `_ ` `________ `____________ 
Whatever is making the market slow today, the impact isn't massive at least. Within the top 100 cryptocurrencies, 26 are currently up. Stellar and EOS continue to be the only coins in the top ten that are up at the time of writing. However, many coins within the top ten aren't far from crossing into the green, Cardano and Litecoin included..

Cardano is the 5th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. As of right now, the coin is selling for $0.379417, which puts the altcoin down by only 0.08% in the past 24 hours..

As can be seen from the chart above, ADA has been all over the place in the last 24 hours. The coin looks to be moving up now but based on its latest movements, I don't know how long that will last..

`_ `______ `____ `________ 
Like Cardano, Litecoin is just barely in the red. The 6th largest cryptocurrency is currently selling for $160.45, which puts LTC down only 0.48% in the past 24 hours..
`___ `_______ `_______ `_ `___ `_____ `_ `__ `___ `__ `__ `______ `_____________ `_ `________ `______ `__ `_______ `____ `___ `__ `___ `___ `____ `_ `__ `___ `_ `______ 
Litecoin's price movements have also been fairly sporadic today..
`_________ `____ `________ `___ `___ `___ `_____ `_______ `______ 

Most people have absolutely no idea what Litecoin is, or that the sixth cryptocurrency of the world by market cap is about to get a fork of its own much like Bitcoin did last year. Some of those who are aware of Litecoin probably know that Litecoin Cash is coming soon, "sold" as a faster version of Litecoin when it comes to transaction times..
`___ `_____ `___ `_________ `_ `___ `___ `_______ `__ `_ `___ `__ `____ `_____________ `_ `__ `____ `_ `_____ `__ `_ `____ `_ `__ ` `___ `_ `__ `__ `___ `___ `______ `__ `___ `____ `___ `_ `____ `__ `__ `____ `_ `_______ `_______ `___ `___ `_______ `___ `_ `_____ `____ `_____ `_ ` `_____ `______ `_ `_______ `___ `_ `____ `_ `__________ `______ 
Whatever the case, you should stay away from Litecoin Cash right now, as the actual founder of Litecoin sees it as a potential scam..
`_______ `__ `____ `__ `_____ `___ `___ `___ `_______ `___ `____ `___ `_ `__ `_____ `______ `_ `_______ `___ `_ `_ ` `________ `_____ 
One of the worries with cryptocurrencies these days and the number one reason why regulation is needed is that anyone can launch their own digital coin and scam people out of money. Rinse and repeat when you're done, there's no law to stop you..
`__ `_ `__ `______ `___ `_______________ `____ `___ `__ `__ `_____ `__ `_____ `__ `_________ `_ `_____ `_ `___ `_____ `__ `_____ `____ `__ `______ `___ `__ `___ `_____ `__ `_ `_____ `____ `__ `_____ `___ `_____ `____ `______ `_ `__ `_ `___ `____ 
That's probably why someone other than the Litecoin creator is now looking to launch a fork that has "Litecoin" in its name..
`_____ `_______ `__ `______ `____ `___ `__ `_______ `______ `_ `__ `______ `_ `_____ ` `___ `___ `__ `_________ `_ `__ `_____ 
As Business Insider explains, Litecoin owners will get 10 Litecoin Cash coins for each Litecoin unit they have when the forks will happen sometime next week. That sounds like a sweet deal, especially if you bought Litecoin token when the price was really low -- the coin rose from $3.73 a year ago to $365 in December before plunging to $150-ish right now..

But you should handle Litecoin Cash with immense care. Just because it has "Litecoin" in its name doesn't make it a legit endeavor..
`__ `__ `_____ `_____ `_______ `___ `___ `______ `____ `___ `______ `_ `__ `_________ `_ `__ `___ `______ `___ `_ ` `____ `_________ 
The goal of the Litecoin Cash coin is, as stated before to increase "blood speed" to 2.5 minutes. That's the speed at which the network can process transactions, which should be faster than Litecoin's. On paper..

Litecoin is currently trading at $157.06, some 0.12% lower than yesterday, so the incoming Litecoin Cash fork is yet to dent Litecoin's market cap or reputation..

A cryptocurrency investment scheme that last month drew the ire of state regulators in Texas announced last week that it was closing its lending platform..

DavorCoin, as previously reported, was likened to BitConnect by the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) given that both involved the use of a lending site and had promised to pay steady interest income to those who invested. On Feb. 2, the board issued a cease-and-desist to Davorcoin, alleging at the time that those behind the scheme had intentionally hidden information from would-be stakeholders..

"The emergency order found that DavorCoin is telling investors they can earn lucrative profits by investing in a lending program based on a new cryptocurrency known as davorcoin. Investors allegedly purchase davorcoin and then lend it to DavorCoin," TSSB wrote at the time..

Less than a week later, those behind DavorCoin announced that they were closing the associated lending platform because of a plunge in the value of the scheme's DAV token..

According to data from CoinMarketCap, the price nearly hit $180 just over a month ago, but by the day of the announcement, the value of DAV was around $3. Press-time data indicates that DAV's value has plunged even further, coming in at roughly $0.03 at press time..

The team wrote in the Feb. 7 blog post:.
`__ `___ `____ `_ `__ `___ ` `___ `_____ 
"There is no doubt for us that the DAV value has been negatively affected by our lending program because the crypto-environment has dramatically changed recently. We did everything possible to protect our platform and our amazing community. However, DAV price still went from $180 to $0.5 in 20 days. As a result, we have decided to change our strategy and to end our lending program that has become the only reason why DavorCoin is decreasing in value.".

The blog goes on to state that those behind DavorCoin will seek to resuscitate its price through "transforming DAV into a strong cryptocurrency." Yet since that date, there have been no official posts on its Medium and Twitter accounts..

Bitcoin's price may be down more than 50% from its highs in December, but no one has told Iceland, where the cryptocurrency and its offspring are reshaping the economy..
`________ `____ `__ `_ `___ `___ `___ `__ `___ `__ `____ `_ `________ `__ `_ `__ `__ `___ `_______ `____ `__ `_____________ `__ `__ `________ `__ `________ `__ `________ 
According to Johann Snorri Sigurbergsson, an employee of the energy company HS Orka, Icelandic cryptocurrency "mining" is likely to double its energy consumption to about 100 megawatts this year. That is more than households use in the nation of 340,000 people, according to the national energy authority..
`________ `_ `_____ `_____ `_____________ `_ `_______ `_ `__ `_____ `______ `_ `____ `________ `_____________ `_______ `_ `_____ `_ `_____ `__ `_____ `__________ `_ `____ `__ `________ `___ `____ `___ `_ `___ `___ `_________ `__ `_ `__ `_____ `_ `______ `______ `________ `_ `__ `_______ `_____ `__________ 
Mining is the name for the decentralised process that underpins the integrity of most cryptocurrencies. Effectively, a bunch of computers engage in a race to burn through the most electricity possible and, every 10 minutes, one wins a prize of 12.5 bitcoin for the effort - still worth more than $100,000, despite recent falls..
`_____ `_ `__ `___ `__ `__ `____________ `______ `___ `________ `__ `________ `_ `___ `________________ `___________ ` `____ `_ `________ `_____ `_ ` `___ `_ `___ `______ `__ `___ `__________ `_______ `___ `____ `_ `_______ `__ `___ ` `____ `_ `___ `______ `__ `__ `_____ ` `____ `____ `___ `___ `________ `______ `_____ `______ 
As the price of bitcoin has risen, so too has the amount of electricity that it is economical to use in order to get the rewards. One recent estimate pegged the energy consumption of the entire network as equivalent to that of the Republic of Ireland..
`_ `__ `____ `_ `______ `__ `_____ `_ `__ `__ `__ `_____ `_ `__________ `___ `_ `_ `_________ `_ `__ `_ `____ `_ `__ `__ `_______ `__ `_____ `_______ `_____ `__ `_____ `__________ `_ `__ `_____ `______ `_ `_________ `_ `___ `_ `__ `_______ `_ `________ 
But the news from Iceland is the first time cryptocurrency mining within one nation has overtaken productive uses of electricity. Why is Iceland so popular? The answer is simple: location, location and volcanoes. Volcanoes provide Iceland with a cheap and abundant form of renewable energy. Geothermal and hydroelectric plants abound on the island, driving down the wholesale cost of power, which lets bitcoin miners make higher profits as they run their computers 24/7, 365 days a year..
`__ `__ `___ `___ `______ `_ `__ `____ `___ `_____________ `_____ `_____ `__ `_____ `__ `________ `_________ `___ `_ `___________ `__ `_ `______ `_ `_______ `__ `_____ `_ `______ `________ `_______ `__ `_________ `________ `______ `______ `___ ` `____ `__ `_______ `___ `_ `________ `______ `_________ `__ `____________ `_____ `_____ `_ `__ `______ `______ `___ `__ `________ `___ `_ `_____ `____ `___ `______ `_____ `___ `_____ `______ `_ `___ `__ `____ `________ `____ `__ `___ ` `_____ 
The country's location, at the northernmost tip of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, provides a second benefit beyond a lot of magma. The Arctic air reduces the need to invest in expensive air-conditioning for the server rooms - crucial, since the specialised chips used to mine most cryptocurrencies produce huge amounts of heat when run at their maximum efficiency..

Of course, even efficient cooling won't help miners eke out profits if the price of bitcoin falls too far. But at least one company based in Reykjavik can handle quite a bit more devaluation: Genesis Mining moved there in 2014 from Germany, when the price of bitcoin was well under $1,000. "What we are doing here is like gold mining," Helmut Rauth, the company's operations manager, told AP. Of course, gold mines eventually run dry. Who knows if the same will happen to bitcoin ones..

Bitcoin gripped the attention of Wall Street and Main Street as it soared to an all-time high close to $US20,000 in mid-December. Investor anxieties about a frothy market, cryptocurrency hacks, and the potential of a regulatory crackdown in some Asian countries have since dragged the entire market for digital coins to half of its peak worth..

Bitcoin's recovery from a low above $US5,900 earlier this month was "impressive," according to the bank. Still, JPMorgan sees a "fairly high risk" of a sell-off towards the $US4,605 level if the digital currency doesn't break through its resistance level between $US10,128 and $US10,776..

"Above 10776 though, the door for a broader countertrend rally to 14334 if not to 16304 (76.4% on different scales) would be wide open," the bank concluded..

Said Ben Bartlett who is spearheading the campaign..
`___ `__ `_______ `__ `_ `___________ `__ `_________ 
Bartlett is working with Neighborly, the University of California at Berkeley's Blockchain lab, and financial tech startup to create the ICO. To date, details are being kept under wraps but the general idea is that investors would buy tokens which are linked to municipal bonds. These tokens could then be spent in local stores and with service providers or dedicated directly to a community improvement project.

ICO's have been widely popular in the Bay area (and around the world) garnering celebrity endorsements from the likes of Boxing legend Floyd Mayweather and personality Paris Hilton. According to Coinshcedule ICO's have raised $3.7 billion in funding in recent years..

In doing so though they have also raised concerns over bogus and fraudulent offerings. The SEC has formed a new 'Cyber Unit' which filed its first suit against an ICO scammer in December..

Berkeley's ICO will be much less volatile than tokens like Bitcoin though as it is to be pinned to the value of municipal bonds. Bonds which cannot fluctuate in price the way cryptocurrency can on the open market..

Neighborly, the Berkeley startup that allows residents to invest directly in projects that benefit the Bay area, sees the ICO as a debut of technology they have been creating to make Cryptobonds possible..

The new Republican tax overhaul which lowered corporate taxes last year also decreased the value of cities tax credits leaving less money for homeless services. As the Berkeley area's homeless has increased to over a 1,000 people in the last five years, Bartlett sees the ICO as a way to make affordable housing available;.

Already slashed by more than half since hitting a record near $20,000 in December, the cryptocurrency could plunge a further 90% in an environment of unsustainably growing supply, according to Bloomberg Intelligence commodity strategist Mike McGlone.

Like U.S. stocks, cryptocurrencies finished last week on a higher note, and that sentiment appeared to be helping keep prices elevated on Monday. Following a late-session rally for Wall Street on Friday, Dow futures YMH8, +1.19% rose nearly 300 points on Monday, with global stocks and oil prices also moving higher..

After facing weeks of mounting negative headlines that had wiped out billions in value, cryptocurrencies won a reprieve of sorts as top U.S. regulators testifying before a Senate committee called for greater oversight without proposing industry-killing measures. That news gave enough positive momentum for traders to shrug off a cryptocurrency ban from Thailand's central bank..

A relatively obscure Italian cryptocurrency exchange is claiming a major hack involving Nano tokens but critics are calling it an exit scam..
` `_________ `______ `______ `_____________ `_______ `_ `_______ ` `____ `___ `________ `___ `_____ `__ `______ `__ `______ `_ `_ `___ `_____ 
Bitgrail claims it was hacked last week of 17 million customers owned Nano Tokens equal on the day to about $195 Million dollars. Bitgrail was one of the main portals for trading the Nano token, previously known as RaiBlocks..

The claim made by founder Francesco Firano has been met with serious skepticism though created in part by suspicious moves made by Bitgrail itself. In January the exchange put a halt to all withdrawals and deposits of Nano, Lisk, and Crytpoforecast tokens. Then they announced identity verification and anti-money laundering protocols and the possibility of blocking non-European users..

These moves generated rumors that the site was setting up what some call an exit scam causing the price of the Nano to drop by 20%. In the wake of the alleged hack, Firano asked the developers of the Nano token to 'fork' their records. That is to change the transaction records in order to restore the lost tokens..

The Nano team immediately took to social media to quash the suggestion that the loss was due in any part to their tech..
`__ `___ `___ `__________ `___ `_ `_____ `____ `_ `____ `__ `_________ `___ `__ `___ `__ `__ `_ `__ `___ `_ `____ `_____ 
"...Firano informed us of missing funds from BitGrail's wallet. An option suggested by Firano was to modify the ledger in order to cover his losses -- which is not possible, nor is it a direction we would ever pursue,".

We now have sufficient reason to believe that Firano has been misleading the Nano Core Team and the community regarding the solvency of the BitGrail exchange for a significant period of time..

`__ `__________ `__ `___ `_______ `__ `_________ `_______ `____ `__ `__ `_______ `___ `__ `___ `_____ `_ `____ `_ `____ `_ `____ `_________ 
Since the initial announcement Firan who tweets @bomberfrancy has continued to put the blame on the Nano developers and claims that he has had several death threats made against him by irate customers who are left holding the bag..

The latest word though is that there was a withdrawal bug that was crediting customers with a double balance allowing thefts to diminish the wallet over months. Traders took to the Twitterverse to connect the bug with the exist scam theory, some saying that bugs like that would most likely be recognized and exploited by someone on the inside..

Bitcoin's supporters are quick to extol the cryptocurrency's virtues as an asset that's uncorrelated to the broader market -- independent from any single country, company or central bank -- which can serve as a haven in times of market turmoil. And while that turmoil can usually be found in bitcoin prices and headlines, last week US equities are beating the largest cryptocurrency on that field..

The 100 SMA is still below the longer-term 200 SMA so the path of least resistance is to the downside. This means that the selloff is more likely to resume than to reverse. In addition, the 100 SMA lines up with the channel resistance, providing an extra upside barrier..

A continuation of the selloff could take it down to the 38.2% extension or to the 61.8% level closer to the channel support and $5,000 mark. Stronger selling pressure could take bitcoin price down to the 76.4% extension at $4,230 or the full extension at $2,271.60..

Following January's huge market correction, February's opening week has seen another round of market decline with cryptocurrency prices making a nosedive. As per the CoinMarketCap website, the top 100 coins and tokens have declined by as much as 35%. Bitcoin, still the leading cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, has declined by around 14% and is currently trading at the $7600 level. The next crucial support for Bitcoin is seen at $7500. Trading lower than the $7500 will test the next support level at $7000. The current price of Bitcoin is the lowest it has been since mid-November, about the same time when the Bitcoin hype began, shooting the price of Bitcoin to the $20,000 level in December 2017..

The Market is Bleeding.
`__ `_____ `_ `________ 
Following the downward trend of Bitcoin, all of the top 20 coins and tokens are currently declining. Ethereum, ranking 2 in terms of market capitalization, is currently trading at $768. Ripple also took a massive hit, trading at $0.75. In terms of total market capitalization, the cryptomarket is currently at the $363 billion level, almost the same level during the first week of December 2017. We are clearly seeing money being pulled out of the market at this time..

Inevitable but Necessary.
`_________ `__ `_________ 
Many traders believe that this huge market correction is inevitable. With the prices of many cryptocurrencies skyrocketing uncontrollably during the month of December 2017, an equivalent correction is bound to happen. Although the price declines are not a pleasant sight, many speculate that this market correction is necessary to help the cryptomarket mature. Quite possibly, the newbie traders and the weak hands are being tested. Veteran traders, on the other hand, are already familiar with the extreme volatility of the market. With these negative circumstances, people will get to know more about the technology of cryptocurrencies, instead of looking at the blockchain innovations as mere money making schemes..

In an announcement today, Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said it has sent letters to seven Hong Kong exchanges and firms attempting to fundraise through initial coin offerings (ICOs), warning them about the legalities of selling digital tokens with the characteristics of securities. Most of those receiving the letter confirmed compliance with the SFC's regulatory regime or delisted tokens in question..

You may have already tested plenty of investment options: capital market, mutual funds, government investments etc. Investing time and money into business can be troubling, but what about moving entirely into the digital environment? Is it worth it to get a loan in order to invest money into bitcoin? Virtual currency has lately been extraordinarily popular, and it is being used in a lot of sectors as the main payment system. This article is meant to answer the most asked question related to this topic: is it worth to invest into bitcoin? Read the pieces of information below and all your uncertainties will be gone in minutes..

Bitcoin (BTC) is a type of electronic currency, also called cryptocurrency, which is developed by people and companies all around the world. What one needs to understand about cryptocurrency is the fact that it has no physical form. The bitcoin network is not controlled by anyone or anything, but the users who are buying or selling..

The answer is yes, you can lose money while investing into bitcoins. This is the reason why you will have to be very convinced of your winning rate, especially if you get a loan just for this purpose. You can lose money in a very short period of time, keeping in mind that the price of a bitcoin fluctuates terribly from one day to another. The system is not pyramidal, and it relies on your ability to analyze the fluctuations that occur with time. You will have to understand how it works and invest in bitcoin at the most appropriate time. If you are not doing so, you are going to risk a large amount of money. This happens especially when investors rush in making a certain decision..

Yes, the price does fluctuate. Investing in bitcoin is risky. The cryptocurrency market is very volatile. One year the bitcoin can cost a few dollars, it can go up to $1000 the next month and drop back to its initial amount a while after. If you are an active type of investor, you can make monthly purchases and sale of bitcoins, which can result in great returns. Don't forget that these investments are taxable, like all other investments out there and any earnings are going to be taxed according to your state affiliation. It depends on the income statement how the profit is going to be calculated..

The value of a piece of art is often hotly debated and can sometimes appear fairly arbitrary. But TORCHED H34R7S, a painting by Marguerite deCourcelle, was far easier to put a price on. The Bitcoin puzzle artwork was worth nearly 5 bitcoins to the first person who could crack the code it held..

The painting was inspired by William Shakespeare's poem, The Phoenix and the Turtle, and contains two coded pieces of information. Decoding and combining these would yield the private key to the Bitcoin wallet containing the coins..

deCourcelle feels that the surge in Bitcoin's price last year led to a rejuvenated interest in the puzzle. But the 30-year-old programmer who eventually solved it had no knowledge of its existence until just over a month ago, as he told Motherboard..

HIGH FEES | The average fee paid to process bitcoin transactions has soared over the past year, outpacing even the staggering price increase of the cryptocurrency itself. Each bitcoin transaction now costs around $7.30 to process, up from around 30 cents at the start of the year, according to trade website BitInfoCharts..

Things are looking brighter during the Asian trading session this weekend. Bitcoin has done better than hold the pivotal $8k level, it has risen to just under $9,000. As usual the movements of Bitcoin are mirrored in the altcoin charts and most of them are trading higher this morning. The leading altcoin however is one that has taken a lot of flak recently. But with a 53% jump in less than 24 hours Tron is on a flyer at the moment..

Social media has been vicious to Tron and its founder. For some reason this altcoin has hit a nerve with the Facebook fanboys that have been bleating on about it for some weeks. It has probably suffered a greater FUD attack than any other cryptocurrency out there, with the possible exception of Verge, and this may be due to the huge attack of FOMO causing the coin to spike from virtually nothing to $0.25 on January 5..

Since then it has been on a downward slide with all other altcoins. Today however Tron is over 50% higher than its trading price the same time yesterday. Currently trading at $0.054 TRX has seen the largest upward movement in the top 25 altcoins this morning. Founder Justin Sun is very active on Twitter where he posts almost weekly updates about partnerships with small Chinese companies. The entertainments based altcoin could easily reach its previous all-time high if a bigger partnership gets announced..

The characteristic volatility of the crypto market, especially over the last few weeks, has some investors experiencing feelings of anxiety and worry. A Moscow-based platform hopes to alleviate some of this stress with the launch of their new hotline..

Even though Bitcoin is partial to price unpredictability, the last few weeks have been quite tumultuous. Just two months ago, the darling of the cryptocurrency world was riding the $20k wave. In addition, major financial institutions either voiced their initial support or swallowed a healthy serving of humble pie along with their previous crypto critique..

The price of bitcoin is trading around $8,000, remaining well below the level of $10,000 seen a week ago and its December peak near $20,000. But this chart could qualm the fears of cryptocurrency investors who wonder if this is the end for cryptocurrencies..

To visualize bitcoin's crash history, HowMuch created 12 boxes representing time periods where bitcoin came under extreme selling pressure. The blue line indicates the percentage of value lost during each selloff. And while this latest selloff could be tough for HODLers who are checking their accounts this week, it's not the worst. Bitcoin lost 87% of its value in the 411 days from Nov. 30, 2013, through Jan. 14, 2015..

It lost 83% of its value in just three days between April 10, 2013, and April 12, 2013. If you had invested just $1,000 in bitcoin at the bottom of that three-day correction at $45, it would be worth about $200,000 today (and would have been worth nearly half a million dollars back in December)..

In fact, the term "Bitcoin" was the second most popular search for global news in 2017. Interestingly, last January's data indicated that the cryptocurrency was due for a major breakout for the year..

Besides lower fees and strengthening fundamentals due to some promising upgrades (e.g. Lightning Network) expected this year, another bullish factor to consider is that the recent sell-off has shaken out the so-called weak hands.

Bitcoin miners face a reckoning as the cryptocurrency's tumble wipes out profits for all but the industry's most efficient operators, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance..

Only miners with access to "very cheap" electricity of about 6 cents per kilowatt hour or less can stay profitable after Bitcoin slumped to $6,000 on Tuesday, said Sophie Lu, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance in Beijing. If Bitcoin stays this low for more than a couple of weeks, miners with high operating costs will leave the market, she said..

Bitcoin's meteoric rise to nearly $20,000 last year prompted hordes of new miners to enter the fray -- everyone from individuals with a single machine plugged into their bedroom wall to companies with giant server farms powered by hydroelectric dams. With prices in the stratosphere, the Bitcoin-denominated rewards that miners received for verifying transactions more than covered the cost of electricity and computing power..

It's been a tense week politically in South Africa, with the annual State of the Nation Address (SONA) postponed until the ruling African National Congress (ANC) determines the fate of president Jacob Zuma. That was reflected in this week's top trending searches, although the country's Google users also sought out celebrity news, the latest from the world of UK football, and information on a very special rocket launch..

If the political career of Jacob Zuma has taught South Africans anything, it's that he's a survivor. Yet, throughout this week, speculation has been rife that the South African president was either going to be recalled by the ANC, or would tender his resignation. Naturally, South Africans took to Google to find out the latest developments. Interest peaked on Monday, when the term "Zuma" saw 50 000+ searches. At the same time, many wondered what would happen with SONA and the opening of parliament, originally scheduled for Thursday. While the postponement was announced on Tuesday, interest was at its highest on Monday, when "Sona 2018" saw more than 20 000+ searches..

Franchise financial institutions also have strong demand for eKYC to increase customer convenience..

`__ `___ `______ `_________ `__ `__________ `______ `_ `__________ `_____ `_ `_ `____ `__ `____ `___________ `_________ `___ `_________ `_ `_______ `______ `___ `__________ 
For businesses, eKYC can help reduce costs and time to verify identity..

In a bid to attract businesses involved in blockchain and cryptocurrencies, Arizona lawmakers have proposed a bill that would allow the state's citizens to pay their taxes in bitcoin. "Arizona State Rep. Jeff Weninger, who introduced the bill, said it was a signal to everyone in the United States, and possibly throughout the world, that Arizona was going to be the place to be for blockchain and digital currency technology in the future," reports Investopedia. From the report: Weninger, a Republican, also cited the ease of making online payments through the cryptocurrency "while you're watching television," as another reason. But he did not divulge much detail about the implementation of such a system. That might be the reason why Weninger faces an uphill battle in getting the bill approved by the state legislature. Bitcoin's price volatility is already being cited as a possible roadblock to implementing such a measure by state legislators. Arizona state senator Steve Farley, a Democrat who's running for governor, said the bill puts the "volatility burden" of bitcoin's price on taxpayers who make payments in U.S. dollars. "It would mean that the money goes to the state and then the state has to take responsibility of how to exchange it," Farley said..
