However, once you've bought the best GPU for mining, along with the best motherboard and best CPU for mining, then you should definitely consider a fast and dependable SSD to help complete your mining rig.. You don't need to buy one with huge amounts of storage, which means you can keep the prices down. We recommend an SSD for mining with a capacity of 120GB for Windows installs, or 60GB if you're going to run Linux. This gives you enough room to install the operating system, along with the best mining software.. As well as speed and capacity, the best SSDs for cryptocurrency mining will also not require too much power to run. This keeps your electricity bills down, and prevents your mining rig from overheating.. 1. WD Blue SSD. Globs of flash storage for less. Capacity: 250GB/500GB/1TB | Interface: SATA | Warranty: 3-years. Excellent priceGood size selectionLimited by interface. If you want to save a few bucks, but don't want to sacrifice too much in the way of performance, the WD Blue SATA SSD is a great compromise. It nearly maxes out the bandwidth of the SATA 3 interface with its read/write speeds, and the price of the 250GB version is brilliant value. Best of all, it's reliable and cost effective to run, making it the best SSD for mining in 2018.. 2. HP S700 Pro. Tough for anything you throw at it.

Its life will far exceed its warranty, offering up 2 million hours of use and up to 650 terabytes written. It's a bit more expensive than the HP S700 Pro, but its build quality is top-notch.. 3. Samsung 850 EVO. A brilliant performer for a great price. Capacity: 120GB/250GB/500GB/1TB/2TB/4TB | Interface: SATA | Warranty: 5 years. Speedy performanceGood-valueDefinitely consumer-class SSD. Although it's been superseded by the Samsung 860 Evo, the 850 Evo is an excellent choice for a mining SSD, as it features Samsung's build quality and speeds that are found in more expensive drives, with a pretty compelling price, especially as you'll only need the 120GB version for your mining rig.. 4. Crucial BX300. The value king. Capacity: 120GB/240GB/480GB | Interface: SATA | Warranty: 3-years. Beats the MX300PriceNot as fast as some other PCIe drives. The Crucial BX300 isn't the fastest SSD you can buy, but it is affordable and chiefly reliable to boot. If you want to maximise your cryptocurrency mining profits by keeping the cost of your hardware as low as possible, then this is an excellent choice. You don't completely lose out on performance either - it's a better performer than the pricier MX300, thanks to MLC NAND.. 5. SanDisk Ultra II SATA III SSD. Compact and fast.
