"Remember how much fun it was when the family used to get together and swap gifts? Paradoxically enough, social media platforms that are theoretically designed to bring kindred souls closer are, in reality, pushing us further apart.\n\nAnd the advent of new technology means that, at least for the time being, consumers are en masse shifting to virtual gifts, be it an e-ticket for an event or a virtual bunch of flowers that can be stored on your desktop.\n\nGIFTO $GTO going crazy now as Palm Beach Confidential (allegedly) seems to have mentioned them.\n\n\"Recommendation: Buy GIFTO (GTO)\n\nBuy-up-to Price: $0.80\n\nStop Loss: None\n\nBuy It On: Binance\n\nStore It On: MyEtherWallet\" -- Crypto Vitalik (@VitalikNakamoto)\n\n15 \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044f 2018 \u0433.\n\nThe Uplive App and Gifto, its crypto brainchild, are here to feed this growing demand. Even the word itself sounds right - \"Gifto\", since this is a newly devised cryptocurrency to serve the already existing Taiwan-based Uplive App, which allows users to send virtual gifts purchased with conventional money.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Disgusting, Noxious Poison': Buffet's Right-Hand Man Pours Scorn on Bitcoin\n\nJust to note, Uplive is somewhere midway between YouTube and Snapchat, which facilitates storage, trade and exchange of purchased presents in a virtual market.\n\nCreate your own customized Valentine's gift with GIFTO! \u1f38a\n\nBored of chocolate and roses?

Their joint venture, the so-called \"Forever Rose\" was auctioned around Valentine's Day for a whopping $1 million to a group of 10 collectors, making it the world's most costly crypto-artwork to date. This makes it really hard to deny the great potential of Gifto, doesn't it?\n\nThe world's most valuable crypto artwork: proof of love on the blockchain by @kevinabosch. Thank you @CNN for supporting the forever rose project \u1f339https://t.co/juXeAfaTps pic.twitter.com/nynNja9VBH -- Gifto (@gifto_io)\n\n16 \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044f 2018 \u0433.\n\n\"People traditionally have valued things they can see and feel. But some of the most valuable things -- like love, for example -- can be felt but not seen,\" the artist told CNN. \"Art reduced to its core essence is about the idea.\"\n\nSince its release in December 2017, Gifto (GTO) prices have performed really well. For the time being, a GIFTO Token is going for $0.397604 USD, which is 39% increase from its initial offering price of about $0.3 USD per token."
