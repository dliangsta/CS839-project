"Bitstamp is one of the oldest and most well respected cryptocurrency exchanges in operation today. Having been in operation since 2011, the exchange has built upon its European user base to become one of the most popular choices with cryptocurrency traders around the world. Bitstamp has offices in a number of locations and provides cryptocurrency trading solutions to clients located across the globe.\n\nBistamp was founded by Damijan Merlak and Nejc Kodri\u010d in 2011, and the pair aimed to provide a service that catered to a European client base and offered an alternative to a market that was dominated by Mt. Gox at the time. After starting out in Slovenia, Bitstamp branched out by opening a UK office in 2013 and one in Luxembourg in 2016. In addition to its office in Luxembourg, the exchange now has a presence in London and New York.\n\nBitstamp has become popular with both intermediate and experienced cryptocurrency traders who are interested in purchasing the more established cryptocurrencies by using fiat currencies. The exchange aims to offer its users a low-fee way of exchanging large amounts of digital currencies and it currently ranks among the top ten for its trading volumes. Bitstamp currently handles over $700m worth of cryptocurrency trades a day, and is one of the top exchanges for BTC/EUR, ETH/EUR trading pairs. However, over 60% of trading on the platform is taken up by USD trades of the top three cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitstamp currently focuses on providing access to the most established cryptocurrencies and operates markets featuring Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Ripple (XRP). There are currently 12 market pairs being traded on the site which are linked to the 3 base currencies of the Euro (EUR), the US Dollar (USD), and Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nAs one of the older cryptocurrency exchanges in operation today, Bitstamp enjoys a high level of liquidity and currently handles over $700m worth of cryptocurrency trades a day.

Bitstamp provides personal and corporate accounts and both require the following documentation to become verified:\n\nThere is also a second verification phase that requires users to verify their phone number by using an OTP code that is sent to their phone. Once the entire verification process is complete, you will gain access all the features of your Bitstamp account and be able to make deposits, purchases, trades, and withdrawals via a number of different methods.\n\nBefore being able to trade or purchase any cryptocurrencies, it's necessary to fund you account. This can be done by navigating to the Deposit tab in your account.

You may sell your cryptocurrency on the exchange or choose to transfer your funds to an external wallet that you control.\n\nBitstamp allows its user to make purchases via a number of different methods. The exchange supports a variety of payment options which include:\n\nBitstamp is one of the industry leaders in terms of its security procedures, and the platform has a good reputation as being a trustworthy exchange. However, Bitstamp has suffered hacks in its past and had to stop trading for a few days after incidents in 2014 and 2015. The latter incident proved to be the most serious as 19,000 Bitcoin were stolen after a successful hack on the exchange.\n\nAs a result of this, the team re-evaluated their security procedures and the exchange currently provides secure wallet options for all its customers. Also, approximately 98% of all funds are held offline in cold storage, meaning that they're inaccessible to hackers. These funds are also fully insured, and the exchange also utilizes Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), mandatory confirmation emails, and SMS alerts in order to secure user accounts. On top of all this, it also uses PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) data encryption to help authenticate and keep all uploaded files private. Since the hack in 2015, Bitstamp has been free of any other incidents and has built itself a reputation as being one of the most secure exchanges in operation today.\n\nBitstamp operates a unified fee schedule which results in a lower fee system than the majority of cryptocurrency exchanges. The exchange maintains a comprehensive list of all its fees, and some of these include:\n\nThe minimum allowable trade is 5 Euro for Euro denominated trading pairs. The minimum allowable trade is 0.001 BTC for BTC denominated trading pairs. The value of minimum trades in other trading pairs will be denominated in the fiat currency of the particular trading pair and limited to 5 whole units of that currency (example: $5, \u00a35, etc.).\n\nBitstamp is a well respected exchange and one with a number of notable achievements and partnerships. As the first Ripple Gateway, Bitstamp was also the first partner in Ripple's incentive programme. The exchange also has partnerships with CACEIS (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole SA) and Swissquote which is testament to its standing within the financial industry.\n\nIt was also the first fully licensed cryptocurrency exchange in Europe and is currently regulated by the Luxembourg Financial Industry Supervisory Commission (CSSF). This ensures that the exchange periodically files reports with the appropriate agencies and is fully compliant in its practices.\n\nThe exchange aims to provide its clients with an overall positive experience and feedback regarding the platform is generally positive. The majority of issues users have with the platform are linked to the customer support service provided as the support team usually take approximately 24 to 72 hours to respond to emails and support tickets. For new registrants, the verification process can also be quite slow as the exchange is currently dealing with a surge of new applicants. However, Bitstamp generally provides its clients with a reliable and efficient platform on which they can trade the more popular cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitstamp is a highly professional exchange that has established itself in the sector after being in operation since 2011. The exchange acts as a gateway into the world of cryptocurrency in a similar way to Coinbase and Kraken and allows new entrants to the market to make cryptocurrency purchases using fiat currencies. The exchange is a good choice for anyone looking for a secure platform that allows its users to purchase currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin.\n\nDue to its low fees for transfers using SEPA, Bitstamp is also a good choice for people based in Europe. However, the exchange still has room to improve its service and can add new cryptocurrencies to its platform as well as integrate direct chat options into its support department."
