["J.P. Morgan has called cryptocurrencies the \"innovative maelstrom\" around Blockchain and said they are \"unlikely to disappear\" in what appears to be an internal report from the company, published Feb. 8, 2018.\n\nIn an extract from what is allegedly the banking giant's executive summary on cryptocurrency, the company appears bullish on crypto's future.\n\n\"Cryptocurrencies are the face of the innovative maelstrom around the Blockchain technology that is bringing both massive price volatility and a constant trial-and-error of new product try-outs and failures,\" the report states.\n\nDespite the report's mixed tone, the distinction from J.P. Morgan's public position on cryptocurrency over the past six months is palpable.\n\nIn September, 2017 J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon became notorious after he called Bitcoin a \"fraud,\" triggering the very price volatility the bank now cites as a \"challenge\" crypto assets face.\n\nDimon subsequently claimed he was \"not going to talk about Bitcoin anymore,\" while last month publicly disclosing he \"regretted\" making the fraud comments.\n\nSpeaking to Cointelegraph at the World Economic Forum in January, 2018, Dimon flatly refuted the idea that he was a \"skeptic\" on Bitcoin.\n\nThe recently published report meanwhile offers ideas as to how cryptocurrencies could be used most effectively.\n\n\"CCs [Cryptocurrencies] are unlikely to disappear and could easily survive in varying forms and shapes among players who desire greater decentralization, peer-to-peer networks and anonymity, even as the latter is under threat,\" the summary continues in a positive vein.\n\n\"The underlying technology for CCs [cryptocurrencies] could have the greatest application in areas where current payment systems are slow, such as across borders, as payment, reward tokens or funding systems for other Blockchain innovations and the Internet of Things, as well as parts of the underground economy.\"\n\nLast week J.P. Morgan was one of several US banks to ban clients from purchasing cryptocurrency with credit cards.", "After the rapper 50Cent made millions from bitcoins, another celebrity has now showed her fascination for the spark of bitcoins, that too quite overtly. The comedian and the talk show host Ellen DeGeneres spoke about bitcoins on her show recently. She says, \"One thing I am down with right now, that I think everybody is learning about, is bitcoin. Who's heard of bitcoin? Who can explain what bitcoin is? Liar. Nobody knows how it works. Nobody.\"\n\nShe further says, \"Everybody is talking about bitcoin; nobody understands it. It's like a plot twist in a confusing movie. When you're watching a movie and your friends act like they know what's going on, and you're like, 'Yeah, I do too!' And then you're like, 'What the hell is every ... I have no idea!' All I know is that bitcoin is either worth twenty thousand dollars or nothing; that's what I know.\n\nIt is worth remembering that an American rapper '50 Cent' last month tweeted about his bounty of bitcoins when his hoard of 700 bitcoins, which he had received for a payment of less than half a million dollars, jumped to a valuation of $8 million.\n\nOn Saturday, a bitcoin is being traded for $10,560 on the Luxembourg-based BitStamp. In Indian exchanges such as CoinSecure, a bitcoin is traded for Rs 6.7 lakh.\n\nThe average price of bitcoin in the cryptocurrency markets worldwide jumps by 4% on Saturday. A week ago, the bitcoin price was $8,621. Two weeks ago, the price had closed at $9,175 on the CoinMarketCap.\n\nBitcoin prices have been under significant pressure on regulatory crackdown.

The bank added, however, that it doesn't view any cryptocurrency as a \"legitimate competitor\" to sovereign currencies.\n\n\"The huge volatility of the price of cryptocurrencies - with respect to either traditional currencies or to a basket of goods and services - has made use of cryptocurrencies as a unit of account impractical,\" it said. \"Only hobbyists are using cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange, at least for conventional transactions for goods and services.\"\n\nJPMorgan added that even if cryptocurrencies were to meet the criteria of cash, they still would have a very difficult time giving a national currency a run for its money because of the network effect of fiat.\n\n\"At any rate, even a hypothetically stable-value cryptocurrency is unlikely to compete with the dollar for transactions in goods and services, in say, Chicago, or to compete with the euro in Stuttgart.\n\n\"Economists have long viewed successful (i.e. relatively price-stable) currencies as natural monopolies in a given geographic area. This particular natural monopoly arises as a result of the inherent network externalities: pricing a New York meal in yen makes little sense, as almost all customers will be holding dollars,\" said JPMorgan.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street bank, the only area where cryptocurrencies could compete with national currencies as a medium of exchange is in the black market.\n\nCEO of JPMorgan Jamie Dimon, who once denounced bitcoin as a fraud that was bound to fail, said last month he regrets the comment, but remains uninterested in digital currencies.", "Atari SA, a holding company of the former Atari Inc., famous for inventing Tetris, watched its share price increase over 60 percent after its crypto investment was made public\n\nAtari SA, a French holding company that contains the former Atari, Inc., inventor of Tetris and Pac Man, has seen its share price go up more than 60 percent after announcing that it would invest in cryptocurrency, Bloomberg reports Thursday, Feb. 15.\n\nAccording to Atari's press release earlier this month, Atari will be creating its own digital currency, the Atari Token, to be used in a Blockchain-based digital entertainment platform created by Infinity Networks, Ltd., in which Atari bought a 17.5 percent stake.\n\nThe company will also develop its partnership with Pariplay Ltd., an online casino-gaming company.

The Bitcoin Cash price, however, continued to post double-digit percentage gains even as other coins began to trade sideways.\n\nYesterday, the cryptocurrency market cap had reached a pinnacle of $486.5 billion, its highest point since Feb. 1. Unfortunately, the market entered Friday on a downward slope, and the cryptocurrency market cap has since declined to a present value of $471.9 billion.\n\nThe Bitcoin price rode a bullish wave this week, rising as high as $10,300 after trading below $8,000 as recently as Feb. 11. On Friday, though, the Bitcoin price dipped back below $10,000.

Investors took heart, in particular, from remarks before the Senate by Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Christopher Giancarlo and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Jay Clayton. Their general message, which came as Bitcoin was bottoming, was: The U.S. doesn't want to quash the market but regulate it.\n\nLayering on the positive sentiment was South Korea. The country helped lower Bitcoin prices this year after imposing stricter regulations and even floating an outright ban on cryptocurrency exchanges. But now it is apparently considering a licensing system for cryptocurrency exchanges, according to reports from Business Korea.\n\nStill, for investors who bought into Bitcoin at the beginning of the year, it's still not smooth sailing. Bitcoin started the year at $14,000, down from an all-time high of about $20,000 in December. Since the start of the year, Bitcoin's market cap is still down by about $60 billion.\n\nAs of late Thursday, the cryptocurrencies had moderated some of their latest gains.\n\nBitcoin is now up 7% at $10,000, Ethereum rose 2% to $926, while Litecoin trades up roughly 1% at $211.", "The company behind iconic video games such as Pac-Man and Pong is planning to launch its own cryptocurrency, dubbed \"Atari Token,\" according to an announcement last week.\n\nAs part of the effort, Atari acquired a 15% stake in a Gibraltar-based company, Infinity Networks, Ltd and has licensed its brand to the firm.

The game maker noted that its investment was \"made without cash disbursement by Atari.\"\n\n\"Our aim is to take strategic positions with a limited cash risk, in order to best create value with the assets and the Atari brand,\" Atari chairman and CEO Frederic Chesnais said in a statement.\n\nThe name selection is a notable one, given that Atari had previously created an Atari Token to serve as a currency for making in-game purchases. Whether the newly-announced Atari Token will serve that purpose remains to be seen.\n\nAdditionally, Atari said that it plans to integrate cryptocurrencies via its branding partnership with Pariplay, Ltd, which offers online games using Atari games and characters as part of their design. Last week's statement also notably hints at the creation of a second token, which would be used in conjunction with the online casino plan.\n\n\"To broaden the appeal of these new casinos, and once the Atari Token available, Atari has the project to launch Pong Token, a second token dedicated to crypto-casinos and usable on these gaming sites.

But unfortunately for the folks at SETI and elsewhere, it's gotten a lot harder in recent months, thanks to a rush on computing power spurred by cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and, to a lesser extent, Bitcoin.\n\nThe root of the problem is an acute shortage of computer graphics cards, known as GPUs. Top-of-the-line consumer GPUs are prized by both cryptocurrency miners and astronomers for their ability to crunch large batches of big numbers at a low price. But as prices for cryptocurrencies have risen, miners have snapped up the cards, driving up prices on secondary markets like eBay.\n\nRadio astronomers studying astrophysical phenomena have also been hit by the shortage.\n\nIn some cases, the GPUs simply aren't available. In others, the grant budgets they wrote months or years ago are no longer sufficient. GPUs that once sold for $500 have doubled in price.\n\nSETI researchers process vast amounts data from a variety of telescopes around the world and in space, including both optical and radio types. Here's Chris Baraniuk, reporting for BBC News:\n\n\"At Seti we want to look at as many frequency channels as we possibly can because we don't know what frequency ET will be broadcasting on and we want to look for lots of different signal types - is it AM or FM, what communication are they using?\" explained Dr Werthimer, who is chief scientist at the Berkeley Seti Research Center.\n\n\"That takes a lot of computing power.\"\n\nBitcoin and other cryoptocurrencies -- the future of money or hype?

While Ethereum can still be profitably mined using consumer hardware, Bitcoin miners have moved on to specialized equipment. If Ethereum miners do the same -- or if the cryptocurrency's value plummets -- it's possible that the GPU crunch will ease.

However, it was a damp squib for the future of Bitcoin as it actually spiked in value.\n\nSince then, forks on Bitcoin have become almost as common as ICOs, and in fact, forks on the Bitcoin chain look to be the latest trend for 2018 as new companies look to cash in on the familiar Bitcoin name.\n\nBitcoin Cash is, of course, the most well known Bitcoin fork out there, sitting comfortably in the top five coins in terms of market cap. However, in 2017, there were 19 registered Bitcoin forks. Still, that pales in comparison to the 50 that are expected this year, according to Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research.\n\nThat number could still rise further as there is even services out there that are providing rudimentary programming skills to launch a clone. This will of course have a big effect in the cryptocurrency market as hedge fund manager Ari Paul predicted in a tweet:\n\nThere are a number of reasons to fork off the Bitcoin Blockchain, some do it, in the case of Bitcoin Cash, to seemingly improve facets of the old coin, while others may have different motives. As George Kimionis, chief executive officer of Coinomi puts it:\n\n\"Unfortunately, most fork-based projects we see today are more of a sheer money grab. Looking back a few years from now we might realize that they were just mutations fostered by investors blinded by numerical price increases rather than honest attempts to contribute to the Blockchain ecosystem.\"\n\nKimionis also sees a new phase in the ICO marketplace with the original hype simmered down somewhat.

The rally enabled LTC/USD to crack the $200 barrier, and it raised LTC/BTC to its highest value in nearly three years.\n\nLitecoin is currently priced at $197 on Bitfinex, although premiums on other exchanges have hoisted its global average just above the $200 mark. Litecoin now has an $11.1 billion market cap, lifting it to fifth in the rankings.\n\nSignificantly, although Litecoin is still trading well below the peak USD value it set in mid-December, LTC/BTC is trading at .0227 BTC, its highest point since July 2015.\n\nDiverging from previous pumps, LTC trading volume is very evenly distributed across the world's major exchanges. At 26 percent, OKEx accounts for the largest slice, while GDAX ranks second with 14 percent. South Korea-based Bithumb and Upbit each prices Litecoin at an eight percent premium over other exchanges, but their trading pairs only account for a combined 10 percent of global LTC volume.\n\nTuesday's rally comes in direct response to the announcement that LitePay, a payment processing company modeled after industry stalwart BitPay, is scheduled to launch on Feb. 26. The company quietly made the announcement on Twitter on Monday, but word seems to have traveled slowly, given that the rally is just now taking off.\n\nAccording to the San Francisco-based company's website, LitePay will offer many of the same features as BitPay. Most notably, it will provide businesses with the ability to accept LTC payments that are settled in fiat currency. Additionally, it will issue Litecoin debit cards, which users can fund with LTC and use at virtually any retailer.\n\nSince Litecoin markets itself as a payment-focused cryptocurrency, the establishment of LitePay's infrastructure will greatly aid its utility for this use case.\n\nHowever, another theory is that Litecoin's bullish pivot could be tied to the announcement that a group of developers is going to fork the main Litecoin blockchain on Feb. 19 to create Litecoin Cash, airdropping coins to all wallet addresses that hold LTC at the time of the fork.", "February 14th, 2018 - Wild Crypto (SYMBOL: WILD), the revolutionary international lottery and eGaming platform built upon blockchain technology, has gone live following last year's successful token sale.\n\nThe platform is the first of the major new cryptocurrency gaming projects to launch, and does so just four months after it raised 10,592 in Ether during a ground-breaking token sale.\n\nWild Crypto offers a range of lottery, slots and bingo games, where players can stake WILD tokens for the chance of winning prizes.

Conmen are using the temporary rise and fall in the value of the cryptocurrency to swindle people of their hard-earned money.\n\nA Sharjah resident has lost Dh2million in such a scheme, according to our report, and readers should watch out for such fraudsters who are using the volatility in the price of the digital currency to profit from it in an illegal way. Leading economist Nouriel Roubini has even predicted that Bitcoin could crash to zero. The American economist last week called it the 'biggest bubble in human history'.\n\nRoubini based his predictions on what is known as \"wash trading\" that traders use to inflate prices. It involves \"buying and selling\" digital orders to tamper with crypto-markets. Reports say this is already happening with regard to Bitcoin, so it's best to go slow until more clarity emerges.\n\nSo, what's really happening in the crypto world, a space fraught with risks, where only those who dare stand to benefit? The market is recovering after last week's blues. On Monday, other digital currencies like Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple were up from between 4 to 10 per cent. Bitcoin flirted with $9,000 before falling. We agree it may be teasing and tantalising even at that rate, if you are prone to flirting with danger, or if you have the money to burn. But it would be wise to lend a ear to what Roubini is saying. A bubble may be in the making without proper control.\n\nMeanwhile, the regulator of Abu Dhabi's international financial centre said it is considering rules for virtual currency exchanges. This is a shift, which bodes well to prevent future volatility and protect investors. Currently, the UAE Central Bank does not recognise Bitcoin as there are fears that it could be used for money laundering and terror financing. A change in policy helps the government keep an eye on digital markets and would be in the best interest of residents.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 Khaleej Times. All Rights Reserved.

Snorri Sigurbergsson, an employee of the energy company HS Orka, claims the consumption of energy by cryptocurrency miners is likely to double to 100 megawatts this year. This is greater than Icelandic households use according to the national energy authority. There are 340,000 people in Iceland. Bitcoin mining Bitcoin mining is explained in the appended video. The Investopedia explains: Bitcoin mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger, known as the block chain, and also the means through which new bitcoin are released. Anyone with access to the internet and suitable hardware can participate in mining. The mining process involves compiling recent transactions into blocks and trying to solve a computationally difficult puzzle. The participant who first solves the puzzle gets to place the next block on the block chain and claim the rewards. The rewards, which incentivize mining, are both the transaction fees associated with the transactions compiled in the block as well as newly released bitcoin. Every ten minutes a miner wins a price of 12.5 bitcoins, still worth over a hundred thousand dollars in spite of a huge decline of more than half of bitcoin's value. Mining has now consumed power to the extent that the entire network consumption is said to be equivalent to that of the Republic of Ireland. In Iceland power consumption by mining has overtaken its other productive uses. The reason is simple. Iceland has a great deal of energy with geothermal and electric plants around the island that is has many volcanoes. Miners look worldwide for cheap and plentiful sources of power. The arctic air cools the server rooms instead of expensive air-conditioning as the chips used to mine produce huge amounts of heat. For now mining facilities are increasing power consumption fast in Iceland Sigurbergsson said that for now there is exponential growth in energy consumption by mining centers. He does not see this stopping at present. He claims that he is getting many calls from investors wanting to build centers in Iceland. However, there are doubters as to the value to Iceland of the increased mining activity. Smari McCarthy an MP from the Pirate Party said: \"Cryptocurrency mining requires almost no staff, very little in capital investments, and mostly leaves no taxes either. The value to Iceland... is virtually zero.\"", "Bitcoin and all things cryptocurrency have found themselves at the top of a list of most highly demanded skills for freelancers in 2018. Leading freelance marketplace, Upwork, recently surveyed their users and found that skills relating to digital currency were the fastest-growing sector of freelancer talents on their platform. The results were also dominated by emerging technologies. Along with Bitcoin, AI and AR related skills were noted as growing rapidly. Evidently, the appetite for those with skills relating to cryptocurrency is not following suit with the price of a single Bitcoin which recently took a tumble from its all-time highs.\n\nAccording to reports from Upwork and the Freelancers Union, those independently employed are preparing for the mass upheavals in the way people work with every great technological leap forward in a more effective way than their peers who work for a single employer. The findings of the two mentioned sources indicate that sixty-five percent of freelancers claimed to be keeping up to date with further career preparation in line with evolving technological sophistication and greater machine learning.\n\nAccording to news outlet Fast Company, the list of skills that clients are seeking from the online talent marketplaces like Upwork are indicative of future work trends in general. This is based on the fact that the number of people working as freelancers is growing three times faster than the rest of the more traditionally employed US workforce. This figure is based on the findings from the survey by Upwork and the Freelancers Union entitled \"Freelancing in America\".\n\nMeanwhile, the planet's top-ranked, private sector think tank, the McKinsey Global Institute, predicts that if freelancing talent platforms such as Upwork continue to grow at the rate mentioned earlier, they could add an additional $2.7 trillion to the global Gross Domestic Product by 2025.

The remarks may be surprising to those who watched bitcoin's price plummet in January, but many inside the cryptocurrency ecosystem, including the Winklevoss brothers, have remained bullish on the future of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general.\n\nTalking to CNBC, Powell answered in the affirmative when asked if he believed cryptocurrencies would reach a $1 trillion valuation, up from today's $417 billion valuation. He reiterated his belief saying:\n\n\"You've got a lot more kids graduating from crypto programs at universities now. I think we're just going to see it continue exponentially from here.\"\n\nIf cryptocurrencies do begin to work their way up to a $1 trillion valuation, it could mean that we'll see another slew of media reports when coins reach new highs, which could, in turn, spur renewed interest for those looking to buy into cryptocurrencies.\n\nOne of the adverse effects of bitcoin has been the resources it requires to be mined.

The DCG, of course, is the parent company of Grayscale Investments, which has created a fund that holds ETC on behalf of fund shareholders.\n\nConsequently, Silbert has a vested interest in promoting ETC. Even so, Silbert's tweet was prescient, because within hours the Ethereum Classic price had embarked on a 20 percent rally -- an advance that came even as other top cryptocurrencies pivoted into negative territory.\n\nAt present, the Ethereum Classic price is trading at $32 on Bitfinex, up from a low near $24.50 on Monday. This translates into $3.3 billion market cap, ranking ETC 14th on the charts.\n\nIt's not immediately clear what is contributing to the rally. There is speculation that it is tied to the upcoming launch of the Callisto Network, which will airdrop its tokens (CLO) to current ETC holders. However, developers have planned the airdrop's blockchain snapshot for block 5500000, which will take place on approximately March 5. Consequently, it seems somewhat doubtful that ETC is surging to such a great degree when the airdrop is still 20 days out.\n\nA glance at ETC's daily trading volume, though, shows a fairly-significant concentration of volume on South Korean exchanges, which currently price it at a premium of roughly seven percent over its value on other exchanges. On Upbit, ETC/KRW is priced at an equivalent value of $34.17, while Coinone prices it as high as $34.27. Altogether, KRW pairs account for more than 37 percent of all ETC trading volume.\n\nThat said, this concentration of trading volume does not necessarily indicate that this is a coordinated pump. Rather, it could be indicative of the fact that South Korean traders -- forced to undergo KYC verification following the adoption of new cryptocurrency trading regulations -- had yet to buy into ETC following the initial Callisto announcement last month.", "Litecoin cash is not affiliated with litecoin in anyway, and litecoin founder Charlie Lee has warned it could be a scam.\n\nLitecoin is down 2.2% Tuesday morning after the cryptocurrency's first hard fork, Litecoin Cash, was announced.\n\nLitecoin holders will receive 10 tokens of litecoin cash for every one litecoin they own, the newly minted Litecoin Cash foundation said Monday.\n\nThe goal of the new currency is to increase the \"block speed\" at which the network can process transactions. The foundation says litecoin cash has a goal block time of 2.5 minutes - faster than litecoin.

The Litecoin network is currently on block 1368028 at the time of writing,according to BlockCypher. The fork is expected to occur sometime around 9 p.m. ET on Monday, February 19.\n\nLitecoin, which was designed to be less energy intensive than bitcoin, saw an astronomical rise in 2017. The cryptocurrency skyrocketed from just $US3.73 a year ago, to as high as $US365 in December, leading founder Charlie Lee to warn investors about the possibility of losing everything. He also sold his entire stake after being accused of price manipulation.\n\nOne week before litecoin cash was announced, Lee tweeted a warning that any fork of litecoin was \"a scam trying to confuse you to think it's related to litecoin.\"\n\nForks aren't uncommon in the cryptocurrency world, although they are not without controversy.

Further, bitcoin also clocked a six-day high of $9,070.64 on Feb. 10, but quickly fell back below the key psychological level of $9,000.\n\nThus, the area around the $9,000 mark has been established as a point of stiff resistance, as is being discussed by the investor community.\n\nAs of writing, bitcoin's global average price on the BPI is at $8,390.

After hitting a record mark of $20,000 in mid-December 2017, Bitcoin's price fell below $7,000 at the beginning of February 2018. As a result, over $60 billion was wiped off the value of the entire cryptocurrency market.\n\nSuch fluctuations undermine the trust of investors and potential users of cryptocurrencies. Few people want to invest in an unstable asset, and it is also hard to use such a tool as a payment method or for remittance purposes due to constant price changes. As a result, cryptocurrencies are becoming just a niche for speculative traders, and the potential for this concept remains unrealized.\n\nThe team behind the Lightcash project aims to solve the cryptocurrency volatility problem and become able to unlock all the advantages of blockchain technology by linking a cryptocoin to the real highly-demanded asset. This is why Lightcash's own cryptocurrency (LCSH) is secured by real gold, mined from deposits in Russia.\n\n\"The Lightcash parent company owns a working gold mining facility in the Amur Region of Russia, as well as a plant for the enrichment of precious metals, and it possesses the necessary state licenses,\" says Vyacheslav Vokin, Lightcash CEO. \"Using this infrastructure we will be able to ensure the stability of our service by issuing own cryptocoin secured by real gold in a 1000:1 ratio.\"\n\nLightcash project closed pre-sale is scheduled for March 2, and the main token sale will take place on March 15.

Because of this, and also due to a number of other circumstances, very few fundamental factors are available for the analysis of the cryptocurrency market,\" Zhanna Kulakova, financial consultant at TeleTrade, told RT.\n\nBesides the bearish news about tightening regulation by governments and banks, the situation for bitcoin is getting worse with the introduction of crypto trading on several large traditional exchanges, because it became easier for institutional investors to take short positions on bitcoin, the analyst says. \"Not surprisingly, after the explosive growth of the market in 2017, large investors chose this strategy,\" Kulakova said.\n\nThat's why it is impossible to forecast the bitcoin price, as it could fall below the new lows, and also jump above $10,000 again, she added.\n\nEldiyar Muratov, president of Singapore Castle Family Office, predicts that the bitcoin price could collapse to the level of $4,300, if the current negative trend continues.

But how much faster can it be before it beats the GTX 1080 Ti? What if the new GTX 2080 could beat the GTX 1080 Ti at a price point of $599 but it is not capable of cryptocurrency mining?\n\nNVIDIA will be shooting themselves in the foot with a refreshed GA104-based GeForce GTX 2080 that even comes close to the performance of the GTX 1080 Ti, because at that points gamers won't want to buy a graphics card from March 2017 when the new GTX 20 series is here. So NVIDIA has to find a way to make its GTX 1080 Ti relevant in a market where the GTX 2080 is out, and that could be from a GPU-level ban of crypto mining on the GTX 20 series cards.\n\nI don't think this purported ban on crypto mining on the GTX 20 series would last long, but 6-12 months would be enough time for NVIDIA to deplete its entire GTX 10 stock worldwide. NVIDIA has a considerable supply of cards on the market, with many more coming, and they're selling all of them. With a GPU-level crypto mining ban on the GTX 20 series, this would allow the GTX 10 series cards to cater to gamers who want to mine and game, or to miners who just want those important hashes.\n\nAfter 6-12 months of the release of the new GeForce GTX 2080, NVIDIA would need to announce and release the GTX 2080 Ti. At this time, NVIDIA would have enough GTX 10 series cards sold, and enough GTX 20 series inventory to announce at the GTX 2080 Ti reveal event that they are unlocking mining on the GTX 20 series.\n\nThis is purely my opinion, but it'll be enough to start an online comment fest between you guys and girls - our readers, and the companies and my sources involved. This would be an interesting step to take, and an easy way for NVIDIA to keep GTX 20 series stock under control in a mining-obsessed market.\n\nAlso remember that NVIDIA has recently said that GeForce graphics cards are for gamers, and not miners, with the company already making retailers aware of this.", "Forget traditional bank robberies, that's like the wild west... especially now that we have cryptocurrency exchanges that can be hacked and a huge $170 million can be stolen at today's lowered values.\n\nThis is what has happened to Italian cryptocurrency exchange BitGrail, with the company announcing on its website that it has lost $170 million to fraudulent transactions, and that they've approached authorities over the matter.

For his class this semester, Mr. Yermack originally booked a lecture hall that could fit 180 students, but he had to move the course to the largest lecture hall at N.Y.U. when enrollment kept going up -- he now has 225 students on board.\n\n\"This is a very precious opportunity for you to be able to sit in this class,\" Dawn Song, a computer science professor, told the students. \"There are a bazillion other students who are waiting for your spot.\"\n\nThe 75 spots in the Berkeley class were divided evenly among the law school, the business school, and the engineering department, and faculty from the three departments are teaching the course together. Ms. Song said she had around 100 students vying for the 25 places set aside for her department.\n\nBecause developments in the field are moving so fast, business school professor also teaching the class, Greg La Blanc, said the students would have to forgive the teachers if they got things wrong on occasion. \"We aren't waiting until we perfect it,\" he said. \"Don't compare it to the perfect blockchain course.

Cryptocurrency miners contributed about $US70 million in sales during the third quarter, and Steves estimates the miners added about $US180 million in sales during the fourth quarter.\n\nAMD, Nvidia's main rival in the space, said about one-third of its graphics division growth came from cryptocurrency miners, which led some investors to worry if the company would be growing without the wildly volatile cryptocurrency market. After it's earnings report, it looks like Nvidia isn't facing the same problems.\n\nThe one blip in Nvidia's stellar report came from the sluggish growth in its automotive division. Nvidia's chips for power infotainment systems and self-driving cars are off to a slow start, but the company could just be a bit too far ahead of the curve, Steves said.

This was mainly due to an increase in cryptocurrency mining during the period, as the Bitcoin price surged. Its excitement surrounding the increase in revenues remain at odds with previous statements, claiming that it would work with retailers to curb sales of its consumer products to miners.\n\nThe company reported an increase of 34% in revenue terms compared to the same period a year prior. These results exceeded analyst's expectations, with gaming - the biggest category - contributing $1.74 billion in revenue. Nvidia launched the $3,000 Titan V during the quarter, in addition to the GeForce Now program that is currently in beta. Second to the aforementioned category was its Data Center products, with this adding another $606 million to its overall earnings.\n\nAlthough a big part of the revenue jump could be attributed to the surge in demand due to cryptocurrencies, Nvidia Chief Financial Officer, Colette Kress remained cautious:\n\n\"While the contribution of cryptocurrency mining to our business is hard to quantify, it is likely to have been higher than in previous years. However, we remain committed to our gaming demands as cryptocurrency trends are likely to remain volatile.\"\n\nThe Nintendo Switch - which sports Nvidia's Tegra chip - was a big driver behind growth as well.

According to Nvidia, its Tegra processor revenue totaled $450 million, growing 75% year-over-year.\n\nNet income for Nvidia was up 71% year-on-year, coming in at $1.118 billion. It also reported a net income for the fiscal year of $3.04 billion, which itself was up 83%.

While Zuck's company floundered, pinioned in the crosshairs of angry lawmakers and increasingly skeptical users, and quickly losing eyeballs, their early bitcoin investments catapulted them into the ranks of billionaires, landing them on Forbes latest iteration of its rich list: \"The Richest People in Cryptocurrency,\" published Tuesday.\n\nBut there's just one problem with the list, and it's directly tied to the problem inherent to the currencies themselves: the market is too volatile to be sustaining, and so are the fortunes of those who have profited from it. As soon as the list was published, major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin saw their values plummet, rendering it immediately out of date. As The New York Times noted, even though the magazine identified about 10 billionaires, many were no longer billionaires once the list went live:\n\nUnlike an ordinary list of billionaires whose fortunes are tied up in stocks, bitcoin billionaires (or millionaires, as it were) don't have to disclose who they are, much less their holdings. While Forbes's list is based on confirmed numbers and quantifiable data, it's also necessarily based on guesswork, thanks to the secretive and often paranoid nature of its users. And as the cryptocurrency market becomes more complex, and more like existing financial markets, it is only becoming more volatile. As of Thursday, bitcoin's price hovered just above $8,000, far below its December peak of $19,000.\n\nFortunately for the Winklevii twins, Larsen, and the rest of the members of Forbes's cryptocurrency list, the erratic nature of the most popular virtual currencies probably means they'll all regain billionaire status soon, if they haven't already. Cameron Winklevoss is certainly looking on the bright side: \"If you look at a $100 billion market cap today, now last week it might have been more like 200, so it's actually a buying opportunity, we think that there's a potential appreciation of 30 to 40 times,\" he told CNBC on Wednesday. \"A lot of people are starting to see that, they recognize the store of value properties.
