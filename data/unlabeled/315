"BITCOIN is the hot topic in the world of amateur and professional currency investment currently.\n\nIts meteoric rise in value over the last year - punctuated by some dramatic falls - has made hundreds of early investors extremely wealthy, meaning that everyone suddenly wants a slice of the action. But what is it worth today?\n\nBitcoin is a virtual currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown computer whizz using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nIndividual Bitcoins are created by computer code.\n\nThe total value of all Bitcoin in existence is now more than \u00a3185billion.\n\nTransactions are made without middlemen, so there are no transaction fees and no need to give your real name.\n\nMore businesses are beginning to accept them and in some parts of the world you can even buy pizza with Bitcoins.\n\nYou can set up a virtual wallet websites like Blockchain to store, keep track and spend your digital money.\n\nYou are also able to purchase Bitcoin through an online exchange or Bitcoin ATM.\n\nTo find merchants that accept Bitcoin in the UK click here.\n\nBitcoins aren't printed, like pounds, dollars or euros - they're produced by people, and increasingly businesses, running computers all around the world.\n\nIt's the first example of a growing category of money known as cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin is attractive to some users because of its anonymity, as well as its lack of government control.\n\nThe website Silk Road was closed in 2013 following raids by the FBI and other agencies amid allegations of drug dealing with authorities seizing millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin during the raids.\n\nThe value of Bitcoin, like all currencies, is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for.\n\nTo process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called 'mining' must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution.\n\nFor each problem solved, one block of Bitcoin is processed.\n\nIn addition, the miner is rewarded with new Bitcoin.\n\nTo compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of new Bitcoins are produced each day.\n\nThere are currently about 16 million in existence.\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol - the rules that make Bitcoin work - say that only 21 million Bitcoins can ever be created by miners.\n\nHowever, these coins can be divided into smaller parts with the smallest divisible amount one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin.\n\nThis is called a \"Satoshi\", after the founder.\n\nTo receive a Bitcoin, a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual postbox.\n\nSince there is no register of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction.\n\nThese addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings.\n\nThe creators of Bitcoin designed the system so there would only ever be a limited supply of bitcoins to be mined (a maximum of 21 million).\n\nTo ensure the longevity of the system, the cryptographic problems involved in the mining get progressively harder, meaning it takes longer to earn them.\n\nMiners are turning to more powerful computers to complete these tasks and earn bitcoin.\n\nAs a result, mining (and on the flipside, bitcoin transactions) are sucking up greater and greater amounts of electricity.\n\nBitcoin transactions now use so much energy that the electricity used for a single trade could power a home for almost a whole month, according to Dutch bank ING.\n\nThe bulk of Bitcoin \"mining\" is done in China, where energy costs are comparatively cheaper than in places like the UK or US.\n\nThis latest development could have a huge impact on Bitcoin's ultimate success.\n\nFutures, as they are known, allow two parties to exchange an asset at a specified price at an agreed upon date in the future.\n\nThe combined value of every bitcoin currently in existence is around $274bn - more than most major companies.\n\nIn theory, investors will now be able to bet against Bitcoin - which could help find the currency's true value.\n\nSeveral marketplaces called \"Bitcoin exchanges\" allow people to buy or sell Bitcoins using different currencies.\n\nJapan-based Mt Gox is the largest Bitcoin exchange. It was launched in July 2010, and by 2013 was handling 70 per cent of all Bitcoin transactions.\n\nPeople can also send Bitcoins to each other using mobile apps or their computers in the same way people send cash digitally.\n\nThe value of Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly since they were introduced and have reached a record high.\n\nIn 2013 when they first came to public attention, the value soared by 10,000 per cent before the price crashed.\n\nIn September 2016, a Bitcoin was being traded for around \u00a3469.\n\nIn October 2017, a Bitcoin was traded for more than \u00a34,000, according to currency tracker XE.com.\n\nAccording to digital currency tracker CoinDesk, on February 15 the price of Bitcoin stands at \u00a37069.96 ($9,931.95).\n\nThis represents a reversal in fortunes since it dropped to $6,914.26 on February 5.\n\nHowever, it's still a way short of its December 16, 2017 peak of $19,343.04, which just goes to highlight the digital currency's volatile nature.\n\nAnyone thinking of investing in Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency should be very careful.\n\nTheir values are incredibly unpredictable, with the ability to plummet as quickly as they shoot up.\n\nOn January 9, 2018, Bitcoin and other major currencies hit the floor after major monitoring platform Coinmarketcap decided to leave out the trading prices from South Korea -- a major market whose absence spooked already jittery investors.\n\nNo one knows what will become of Bitcoin as it is mostly unregulated, but that could change as governments are concerned about taxation and their lack of control over it.\n\nSo its' USP - the anonymity - could eventually prove its downfall.\n\nWhile it keeps Bitcoin users' transactions private, it also lets them buy or sell anything without easily tracing it back to them.\n\nThat's why it has become the currency of choice for people online buying drugs or other illicit activities.\n\nAnd not many governments will put up with that for long.\n\nHowever, it is increasingly used in shops and restaurants - with a fraction of a bitcoin used to buy a pizza, for instance.\n\nAnd people selling their houses have even said they are willing to accept the cryptocurrency.\n\nDaniel Roy put his \u00a31.65million townhouse in Peckham, South London, on the market for 500 bitcoin in September 2017.\n\nThe following month a newbuild family home in Colchester, Essex, was marketed for 82.55 bitcoin, equivalent to around \u00a325,000 less than if paying in sterling."
