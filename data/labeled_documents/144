By comparison, the average expense ratio of smart beta ETFs - - those that replicate traditional styles of active management such as value, quality and momentum - - is 0.26 percent..

The industry is also about democratizing investing - - bringing investing styles to ordinary investors that have traditionally been available only to institutional and high - net - worth investors - - and nurturing new ideas.
