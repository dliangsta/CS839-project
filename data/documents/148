"The value of bitcoin has surged once again, leading to predictions it will rise to $10,000 (\u00a37,118) by the weekend.\n\nIt comes after the price of the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency rallied on Wednesday morning, touching $8,900 (\u00a36,417) according to CoinDesk, as the European Central Bank ruled out a ban on digital currencies.\n\nIt then made strong gains on Wednesday afternoon, peaking at $9,496 (\u00a36,763) shortly before midnight GMT, then continued to climb on Thursday morning reaching $9,870 (\u00a37,029).\n\nChristopher Keshian, chief executive of $APEX Token Fund, said: \"The current prices of many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, are at levels similar to what we saw last year, prior to the incredibly aggressive bull market in the latter part of 2017.\n\n\"We are now observing healthy support levels and pull backs as part of the normalisation from an outlying and momentarily unsustainable growth curve.\"\n\nHe added: \"Ultimately, we believe cryptocurrencies are in a bull market - but that the upward curve will be jagged one.\"\n\nThe stabilisation follows weeks of turbulence as the value of bitcoin rose and plummeted in cycles that left investors on the edges of their seats.\n\nRussian company the Blockchain Fund launched a hotline to help support investors suffering anxiety as the price crashed below $6,000 (\u00a34,272) earlier this month.\n\nThe move came amid concerns that the huge changes in the crypto market could spark severe stress for investors, and even lead to suicides.\n\n\"Some people are in a panic, they don't understand what is happening. At first everything was so good in this market, and now it has faced such changes,\" Elena Pikhovkina, a psychologist working on the hotline, told Russian site Life.ru.\n\nBitcoin hit a record high in mid-December as prices soared to $19,850 (\u00a314,310) - but tumbled in the first month of 2018.\n\nIt finally plummeted to $6,000 (\u00a34,325) in early February as a series of high-profile thefts and fears of regulation demolished its gains.\n\nSouth Korea recently barred people from trading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies anonymously, but said it is not planning to ban digital currency exchanges.\n\nMeanwhile, Theresa May hinted that the UK government may introduce similar measures, while the US government has fretted over the cryptocurrency's popularity with criminals."
