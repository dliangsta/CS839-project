"Overall bitcoin's value has fallen to devastating lows in 2018 after a dramatic start to the year - the currency is now bouncing back\n\nBITCOIN is the world's leading cryptocurrency and has sent shockwaves through the financial markets.\n\nIts meteoric rise in value last year has been followed by an equally dramatic plunge - but what is it worth today?\n\nBitcoin was trading at \u00a37,140 ($9,740) on February 15 - which is up a huge 12% on the previous day.\n\nTrading has been extremely volatile with large swings up and down as regulators worldwide have signalled a crackdown on the \"Ponzi scheme\" cryptocurrency.\n\nThere are hopes however as the market itself is embracing calls for regulation and this may be what is giving BTC a new hope.\n\nAt the depths of its free-fall, bitcoin's value had fallen by nearly three quarters since its record high of \u00a314,837 on December 18.\n\nIts price was damaged by South Korea's plan to ban anonymous cryptocurrency trading, sending the market into a tailspin.\n\nJustice minister Park Sang-ki said the government was preparing a bill to ban trading of the virtual currency on domestic exchanges.\n\nHe said: \"There are great concerns regarding virtual currencies.\"\n\nAnalysts had warned of a bubble after the price soared beyond $10,000 for the first time in late November 2017 and peaked at almost twice that three weeks later.\n\nThe surge was attributed to demand in China, where authorities warn bitcoin is used to channel money out of the country.\n\nEBay even considered accepting bitcoin payments as it entered the mainstream with a listing on a US exchange.\n\nBut investors are worried by the currency's volatile nature and the market's inability to cope with sudden shifts in demand.\n\nBitcoin is a virtual currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown computer whizz using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nIndividual Bitcoins are created by computer code.\n\nThe total value of all Bitcoin in existence is now more than \u00a3112billion.\n\nTransactions are made without middlemen, so there are no transaction fees and no need to give your real name.\n\nMore businesses are beginning to accept them and in some parts of the world, you can even buy pizza with Bitcoins.\n\nYou can set up a virtual wallet website like Blockchain to store, keep track and spend your digital money.\n\nYou are also able to purchase Bitcoin through an online exchange or Bitcoin ATM.\n\nTo find merchants that accept Bitcoin in the UK click here.\n\nBitcoins aren't printed, like pounds, dollars or euros - they're produced by people, and increasingly businesses, running computers all around the world.\n\nIt's the first example of a growing category of money known as cryptocurrency.\n\nThe value of Bitcoin, like all currencies, is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for.\n\nTo process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called 'mining' must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution.\n\nFor each problem solved, one block of Bitcoin is processed.\n\nIn addition, the miner is rewarded with new Bitcoin.\n\nTo compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of new Bitcoins are produced each day.\n\nThere are currently about 16 million in existence.\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol - the rules that make Bitcoin work - say that only 21 million Bitcoins can ever be created by miners.\n\nBut these coins can be divided into smaller parts with the smallest divisible amount one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin.\n\nThis is called a \"Satoshi\", after the founder.\n\nTo receive a Bitcoin, a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual postbox.\n\nSince there is no register of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction.\n\nThese addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings."
