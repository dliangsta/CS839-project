"Venezuela will launch its new oil-backed cryptocurrency today (Feb. 20) - the \"petro\" - in a direct effort to shirk U.S. sanctions.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro hopes to raise foreign investments as his country faces 13,000% inflation, plus food and medicine shortages, purportedly worsened by international sanctions.\n\nThose very sanctions have allegedly rendered Maduro unable to refinance Venezuela's crippling debt burden, which, in turn, led Socialist Party officials to seek new forms of raising hard currency.\n\n\"The petro digital currency would appear to be an extension of credit to the Venezuelan government... [and] could therefore expose U.S. persons to legal risk,\" a Treasury spokesperson told Reuters this morning.\n\nHowever, critics say that sanctions are not the reason the country's economy is collapsing.\n\n\"The main reason Venezuela can't raise financing is that macroeconomic finance is a s*** show,\" Francisco Toro, a Venezuelan journalist, told CNBC yesterday.\n\nRegardless of the cause of Caracas' crisis, Maduro is pressing forward with the sale of 82.4 million petro tokens via \"pre-sale\" today. Each will be backed by Venezuelan commodities - oil, gas, gold, and diamond reserves, in particular.\n\nThe rest of the coins, of which there are 100 million total, will go on sale next month.\n\nAlready, it seems that there are some interested buyers - at least, according to Caracas' cryptocurrency regulator, Carlos Vargas, last week, who said that it would draw investments from Qatar, Turkey, and other Middle Eastern countries.\n\nWhile we don't expect the petro's introduction today to shake up the global crypto market, this is just the start of a global trend of using cryptocurrencies to circumvent U.S. sanctions.\n\nHere's who's next...\n\nRussia is already looking to take advantage of the crypto craze.\n\nOn Jan. 2, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly commissioned work to create a cryptocurrency as a tool to evade punitive trade measures. His economic adviser Sergey Glazyev said, \"a crypto-ruble would be a useful tool to get around international sanctions,\" according to The Financial Times that day.\n\nCryptocurrency as a whole provides the means for sanctions evasion because of the anonymity and the plausible deniability its transactions provide.\n\nCheck out our free research service that finds the most profitable, current opportunities in cryptocurrencies today right here.\n\nDigital coin transactions allow for the buying and selling of assets across borders with minimal oversight, if any.\n\nPlus, crypto transactions move fast; they can go from country to country in a matter of seconds, and from digital to tangible fiat form just as fast.\n\nForeign investors who put money into these assets could therefore unwittingly - or, at least, complacently - support a hostile regime with their investments.\n\nFor instance, \"crypto-ruble\" purchasers in the United States would ostensibly be supporting a nation believed to have interfered in the U.S. election and in other countries' political systems.\n\nAnd for Venezuela, investors will finance a dictatorship that has abused anti-government protesters and deprived citizens of economic opportunity.\n\nSo naturally, we don't recommend investing in the petro, or any future government-backed cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, Money Morning's options trading specialist, Tom Gentile, did just reveal his first crypto trade recommendation, which you can see right here...\n\nTom Gentile, America's No.1 Pattern Trader, uses stringent criteria to vet his trade recommendations - showing readers 81 triple-digit winning moves in 2017 alone.\n\nNow he's seeing the \"Buy\" signal on a cryptocurrency trade he thinks could turn a small stake into more than $40,000, based on his analysis.\n\nIn a special video presentation, Tom walks you through the process for placing this crypto trade.
