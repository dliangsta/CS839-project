"The Commonwealth Bank has banned its customers from buying bitcoin on credit cards after the recent plunge in the cryptocurrency's value, saying such purchases are no longer \"appropriate.\"\n\nThe country's largest bank on Wednesday started sending text messages alerting affected customers to the ban, which follows similar action by large banks overseas in the wake of a more than 50 per cent plunge in bitcoin's value from last year's peaks.\n\nThe crackdown comes amid concern among banks overseas that further sharp falls in the price of bitcoin could leave some customers with large debts, creating extra risk for banks.\n\nIt is understood CBA also has concerns about the risk to customers' financial welfare of allowing people to borrow to invest in such a volatile asset at credit card interest rates, often near 20 per cent.\n\nCBA is not stopping customers from using their own money to buy bitcoin as it will continue to allow purchases through debit cards or transaction accounts."
